'''Nicholas Jerry Jonas''' (born September 16, 1992)<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.allmusic.com/artist/nick-jonas-mn0002515882 | title = Nick Jonas | publisher = [[AllMusic]] | access-date= November 10, 2013}}</ref> is an American singer, songwriter and actor. Jonas began acting on Broadway at the age of seven, and released his debut single in 2002; this caught the attention of [[Columbia Records]], where Jonas formed a band with his older brothers, [[Kevin Jonas|Kevin]] and [[Joe Jonas|Joe]], known as the [[Jonas Brothers]]. The group released their debut studio album, ''[[It's About Time (Jonas Brothers album)|It's About Time]],'' through the Columbia label in 2006. After leaving Columbia Records and signing with [[Hollywood Records]], the group released their [[Jonas Brothers (album)|self-titled second studio album]] in 2007, which became their breakthrough record. The band became prominent figures on the [[Disney Channel]] during this time, gaining a large following through the network, and appeared in the widely successful musical television film ''[[Camp Rock]]'' (2008) and its sequel ''[[Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam]]'' (2010), as well as two of their own series, ''[[Jonas Brothers: Living the Dream]]'' (2008–2010) and ''[[Jonas (TV series)|Jonas]]'' (2009–2010).

The band's third studio album, ''[[A Little Bit Longer]]'' (2008), saw continued commercial success for the group; the album's lead single "[[Burnin' Up (Jonas Brothers song)|Burnin' Up]]" hit the top five on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. Following the release of their fourth studio album, ''[[Lines, Vines and Trying Times]]'' (2009), the Jonas Brothers confirmed a hiatus. Jonas formed a new band known as [[Nick Jonas & the Administration]], who released the album ''[[Who I Am (Nick Jonas & the Administration album)|Who I Am]]'' in 2010. Afterward, Jonas shifted his focus to acting and had a recurring role on the television series ''[[Smash (U.S. TV series)|Smash]]'' and some Broadway shows roles.

After the group's official disbandment in 2013, Jonas began work on his second solo studio album, signing with [[Island Records]] and releasing ''[[Nick Jonas (album)|Nick Jonas]]'' through the label in 2014, which saw the commercial success of the single "[[Jealous (Nick Jonas song)|Jealous]]". Jonas later co-founded [[Safehouse Records]], a record label in conjunction with the Island and Hollywood labels. His third studio album ''[[Last Year Was Complicated]]'' (2016) peaked at number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart in the United States. Following the release, Jonas won the Songwriters Hall of Fame's Hal David Starlight Award in 2016.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.songhall.org/special-awards | title = Songwriters Hall of Fame Special Awards | publisher = [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] | access-date= December 12, 2013}}</ref> In 2017, Jonas appeared in the adventure comedy film ''[[Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle]]'', which became the [[2017 in film#Highest-grossing films|fifth highest-grossing film of the year]]. The Jonas Brothers reformed in early 2019, and released the album ''[[Happiness Begins]]'' in June of that year. Jonas' fourth solo studio album, ''[[Spaceman (Nick Jonas album)|Spaceman]]'', was released on March 12, 2021.

Both Dallas and nearby [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] were initially developed as a product of the construction of major railroad lines through the area allowing access to cotton, cattle, and later oil in North and [[East Texas]]. The construction of the [[Interstate Highway System]] reinforced Dallas's prominence as a transportation hub, with four major interstate highways converging in the city and a fifth interstate loop around it. Dallas then developed as a strong industrial and financial center and a major inland port, due to the convergence of major railroad lines, interstate highways, and the construction of [[Dallas Fort Worth International Airport]], one of the largest and [[List of busiest airports by passenger traffic|busiest airports]] in the world.<ref name="handbook_dallas2">{{Handbook of Texas|id=hdd01|name=Dallas, TX|first1=Jackie |last1=McElhaney |first2=Michael V. |last2=Hazel|retrieved=April 20, 2006}}</ref> In addition, [[Dallas Area Rapid Transit]] (DART) operates rail and bus transit services throughout the city and its surrounding suburbs.<ref>{{Cite web |title=DART Rail System Map |url=https://dart.org/maps/printrailmap.asp |access-date=September 16, 2020 |website=dart.org}}</ref>

With the construction of railroads, Dallas became a business and trading center and was booming by the end of the 19th century. It became an industrial city, attracting workers from [[Texas]], the South, and the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. The [[Praetorian Building]] in Dallas of 15 stories, built in 1909, was among the first [[skyscrapers]] west of [[Mississippi River|the Mississippi]] and the tallest building in Texas for some time.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Dallas' Tallest|url=https://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-magazine/1996/october/dallas-tallest/|access-date=September 16, 2020|website=D Magazine|date=October 1996 |language=en}}</ref> It marked the prominence of Dallas as a city. A racetrack for [[thoroughbred]]s was built and their owners established the Dallas Jockey Club. Trotters raced at a track in Fort Worth, where a similar drivers club was based.

{{Main|Geology of the Dallas–Fort Worth Metroplex}}
Dallas and its surrounding area are mostly flat. The city lies at elevations ranging from {{convert|450|to|550|ft|m|0}} above sea level. The western edge of the Austin Chalk Formation, a [[limestone]] [[escarpment]] (also known as the "White Rock Escarpment"), rises {{convert|230|ft|m|0}} and runs roughly north–south through Dallas County. South of the [[Trinity River (Texas)|Trinity River]], the uplift is particularly noticeable in the neighborhoods of Oak Cliff and the adjacent cities of Cockrell Hill, [[Cedar Hill, Texas|Cedar Hill]], [[Grand Prairie, Texas|Grand Prairie]], and [[Irving, Texas|Irving]]. Marked variations in terrain are also found in cities immediately to the west in [[Tarrant County, Texas|Tarrant County]] surrounding Fort Worth, as well as along Turtle Creek north of Downtown.

Dallas, like many other cities, was founded along a river. The city was founded at the location of a "white rock crossing" of the Trinity River, where it was easier for wagons to cross the river in the days before ferries or bridges. The Trinity River, though not usefully navigable, is the major waterway through the city. [[Interstate 35E (Texas)|I-35E]] parallels its path through Dallas along the [[Stemmons Corridor]], then south alongside the western portion of Downtown and past South Dallas and Pleasant Grove, where the river is paralleled by [[Interstate 45 (Texas)|Interstate 45]] until it exits the city and heads southeast towards [[Houston]]. The river is flanked on both sides by {{convert|50|ft|m|0}} tall earthen [[levee]]s to protect the city from frequent floods.<ref>{{cite web|author=John N.

Since it was rerouted in the late 1920s, the river has been little more than a drainage ditch within a floodplain for several miles above and below Downtown, with a more normal course further upstream and downstream, but as Dallas began shifting towards postindustrial society, public outcry about the lack of aesthetic and recreational use of the river ultimately gave way to the [[Trinity River Project]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Discover The Trinity-Dallas |work=Discover The Trinity |publisher=Discoverthetrinity.org |access-date=September 12, 2009 |url=http://www.discoverthetrinity.org/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925092304/http://www.discoverthetrinity.org/ |archive-date=September 25, 2009 |url-status=usurped }}</ref> which was begun in the early 2000s.

[[White Rock Lake]] and [[Joe Pool Lake]] are reservoirs that comprise Dallas's other significant water features. Built at the beginning of the 20th century, White Rock Lake Park is a popular destination for boaters, rowers, joggers, and bikers, as well as visitors seeking peaceful respite from the city at the {{convert|66|acre|m2|-3|adj=on}} [[Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Garden]], on the lake's eastern shore.

Dallas has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Cfa'', [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]]: ''Cfhk'') characteristic of the [[Great Plains|Southern Plains]] of the United States. It also has both continental and tropical characteristics, characterized by a relatively wide annual temperature range for the latitude. Located at the lower end of [[Tornado Alley]], it is prone to extreme weather, tornadoes, and hailstorms.

Summers in Dallas are very hot with high humidity, although extended periods of dry weather often occur. July and August are typically the hottest months, with an average high of {{convert|96.0|°F|°C|0|lk=on}} and an average low of {{convert|76.7|°F|°C|0}}. Heat indices regularly surpass {{convert|105|°F|°C|0}} due to elevated humidity during the summer months, making the summer heat almost unbearable. The all-time record high is {{convert|113|°F|0}}, set on June 26 and 27, 1980 during the [[Heat Wave of 1980]] at nearby [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]].<ref name="NOAA Online" /><ref name="NWS Records">{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/fwd/?n=dgr8mxmn|title=Dallas/Fort Worth – All-Time Maximum and Minimum Temperatures|publisher=National Weather Service Fort Worth|access-date=December 5, 2011}}</ref>

Winters in Dallas are usually mild, with occasional cold spells.

The normal daily average temperature in January is {{convert|47.0|°F|0}} but sharp swings in temperature can occur, as strong cold fronts known as "[[Texas Norther|Blue Norther]]s" pass through the Dallas region, forcing temperatures below the {{convert|40|°F|0}} mark for several days at a time and often between days with high temperatures above {{convert|80|°F|0}}.

Spring and autumn are transitional seasons with moderate and pleasant weather.

Late spring to early summer also tends to be the most humid, with humidity levels frequently exceeding 75%. The weather in Dallas is also generally pleasant from late September to early December and on many winter days. Autumn often brings more storms and tornado threats, but they are usually fewer and less severe than in spring.

Each spring, cold fronts moving south from the North collide with warm, humid air streaming in from the [[Gulf Coast]], leading to severe [[thunderstorm]]s with [[lightning]], torrents of rain, [[hail]], and occasionally, [[tornado]]es. Over time, tornadoes have probably been the most significant natural threat to the city, as it is near the heart of [[Tornado Alley]].

A few times each winter in Dallas, warm and humid air from the south will override cold, dry air, resulting in [[freezing rain]] or ice and causing disruptions in the city if the roads and highways become slick. Temperatures reaching {{convert|70|°F|0}} on average occur on at least four days each winter month.

===Crime===

According to the FBI, a city to city comparison of crime rates can be misleading, because recording practices vary from city to city, citizens report different percentages of crimes from one city to the next, and the actual number of people physically present in a city is unknown.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/06prelim/ |title=Preliminary Annual Uniform Crime Report, January–December, 2006 |publisher=Fbi.gov |date=June 4, 2007 |access-date=May 23, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114195803/http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/06prelim/ |archive-date=January 14, 2010}}</ref> With that in mind, Dallas has one of the top 10 crime rates in Texas and its crime rate is higher than the national average.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://kqvt.com/1-violent-texas-city/ |last1=pooks |website=Q92 | title=Here is the #1 Most Violent City in the Entire State of Texas | date=September 2, 2023 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Dallas-Fort Worth, TX, Crime Rate & Safety |url=https://realestate.usnews.com/places/texas/dallas-fort-worth/crime |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240225025950/https://realestate.usnews.com/places/texas/dallas-fort-worth/crime |archive-date=2024-02-25 |website=U.S. News}}</ref>

In its beginnings, Dallas relied on farming, neighboring [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]]'s [[Fort Worth Stockyards|Stockyards]], and its prime location on Native American trade routes to sustain itself. Dallas's key to growth came in 1873 with the construction of multiple [[Rail road|rail]] lines through the city. As Dallas grew and technology developed, cotton became its boon and by 1900, Dallas was the largest inland cotton market in the world, becoming a leader in [[cotton gin]] machinery manufacturing.

By the early 1900s, Dallas was a hub for economic activity all over the Southern United States and was selected in 1914 as the seat of the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas|Eleventh Federal Reserve District]]. By 1925, Texas churned out more than {{frac|1|3}} of the nation's cotton crop, with 31% of Texas cotton produced within a {{convert|100|mi|km|adj=on}} [[radius]] of Dallas. In the 1930s, petroleum was discovered east of Dallas, near [[Kilgore, Texas|Kilgore]]. Dallas's proximity to the discovery put it immediately at the center of the nation's petroleum market. Petroleum discoveries in the [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]], the [[Texas Panhandle|Panhandle]], the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]], and [[Oklahoma]] in the following years further solidified Dallas's position as the hub of the market.<ref name="paynechapV">{{cite book|last=Payne |first=Darwin |title= Dallas, an illustrated history |year=1982 |publisher=Windsor Publications |location=Woodland Hills, California |isbn= 0-89781-034-1 |pages=189–221 |chapter= Chapter VII: The Emergence of "Big D"}}</ref>

The end of [[World War II]] left Dallas seeded with a nexus of communications, engineering, and production talent by companies such as Collins Radio Corporation. Decades later, the telecommunications and information revolutions still drive a large portion of the local economy. The city is sometimes referred to as the heart of "[[Silicon Prairie]]" because of a high concentration of telecommunications companies in the region, the epicenter of which lies along the [[Telecom Corridor]] in [[Richardson, Texas|Richardson]], a northern suburb of Dallas. The Telecom Corridor is home to more than 5,700 companies including [[Texas Instruments]] (headquartered in Dallas), [[Nortel Networks]], [[Alcatel Lucent]], [[AT&T Inc.|AT&T]], [[Ericsson]], [[Fujitsu]], [[Nokia]], [[Rockwell Collins]], [[Cisco Systems]], [[T-Mobile US|T-Mobile]], [[Verizon Communications]], and [[CompUSA]] (which is now headquartered in [[Miami]], [[Florida]]).<ref>[http://www.telecomcorridor.com/ Telecom Corridor website].

In the 1980s Dallas was a real estate hotbed, with the increasing metropolitan population bringing with it a demand for new housing and office space. Several of [[Downtown Dallas|Downtown]] Dallas's largest buildings are the fruit of this boom, but over-speculation, the [[savings and loan crisis]] and an oil bust brought the 1980s building boom to an end for Dallas as well as its sister city Houston. Between the late 1980s and the early 2000s, central Dallas went through a slow period of growth. However, since the early 2000s the central core of Dallas has been enjoying steady and significant growth encompassing both repurposing of older commercial buildings in Downtown Dallas into residential and hotel uses, as well as the construction of new office and residential towers. The opening of [[Klyde Warren Park]], built across [[Texas State Highway Spur 366|Woodall Rodgers Freeway]] seamlessly connecting the central Dallas CBD to Uptown/Victory Park, has acted synergistically with the highly successful Dallas Arts District, so both have become catalysts for significant new development in central Dallas.

The residential real estate market in the [[Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex]] has not only been resilient but has once again returned to a boom status. Dallas and the greater metro area have been leading the nation in apartment construction and net leasing, with rents reaching all-time highs. Single family home sales, whether pre-owned or new construction, along with home price appreciation, were leading the nation since 2015.<ref name="Economic Snapshot">{{cite news|title=DFW Apartment Boom Hits Region|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2015/07/01/dfw-apartment-boom-hits-region-with-all-time.html|newspaper=Dallas Business Journal|access-date=July 1, 2015}}</ref><ref name="Dallas Residential Real Estate">{{cite news | title = Dallas Area Home Price Growth Dwarfs National Gains | url = https://www.dallasnews.com/business/residential-real-estate/20150630-dallas-area-home-price-growth-dwarfs-national-gains.ece | first = Steve | last = Brown | newspaper = [[The Dallas Morning News]] | date = June 30, 2015 | access-date = June 30, 2015 | archive-date = July 7, 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150707010853/http://www.dallasnews.com/business/residential-real-estate/20150630-dallas-area-home-price-growth-dwarfs-national-gains.ece | url-status = dead }}</ref>

A sudden drop in the price of oil, starting in mid-2014 and accelerating throughout 2015, has not significantly affected Dallas and its greater metro area due to the highly diversified nature of its economy. Dallas and the metropolitan region continue to see strong demand for housing, apartment and office leasing, shopping center space, warehouse and industrial space with overall job growth remaining very robust. Oil-dependent cities and regions have felt significant effects from the downturn, but Dallas's growth has continued unabated, strengthening in 2015. Significant national headquarters relocations to the area (as exemplified by Toyota's decision to leave [[California]] and establish its new North American headquarters in the Dallas area) coupled with significant expansions of regional offices for a variety of corporations and along with company relocations to Downtown Dallas helped drive the boom in the Dallas economy.

Dallas has several local newspapers, magazines, television stations and radio stations that serve the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, which is the fifth-largest [[media market]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.arbitron.com/radio_stations/mm001050.asp |title=Fall 2006 Market Ratings |publisher=Arbitron.com |access-date=May 11, 2013}}</ref> Dallas has one major daily newspaper, ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'', which was founded in 1885 by [[A. H. Belo]] and is A. H. Belo's flagship newspaper.

The ''[[Dallas Times Herald]]'', started in 1888, was the ''Morning News''' major competitor until Belo purchased it on December 8, 1991, and closed the paper down the next day. Other daily newspapers are ''[[Al Día (Dallas)|Al Día]]'', a Spanish-language paper published by Belo, and a number of ethnic newspapers printed in languages such as [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]].

Other publications include the ''Dallas Weekly'' and the ''Elite News'', all weekly news publications. The ''[[Dallas Observer]]'' and the ''North Texas Journal'' are also alternative weekly newspapers. ''The Dallas Morning News'' formerly had a weekly publication, ''[[Neighborsgo]]'', which came out every Friday and focused on community news. Readers could post stories and contribute content to the website.

''[[D Magazine]]'' is a notable monthly magazine about business, life, and entertainment in Dallas–Fort Worth. Local visitor magazines include "WHERE Magazine" and "Travelhost"–available at hotel desks or in guest rooms. In addition, the park cities and suburbs such as Plano also have their own community newspapers. Also, ''THE Magazine'' covers the contemporary arts scene.<ref>{{Cite web|title=THE Magazine DFW|url=https://artandseek.org/calendar/organization/2284/the-magazine-dfw|access-date=September 16, 2020|website=artandseek.org}}</ref>

In terms of the larger metro area, the ''[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]'' is another major daily newspaper, covering [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]]'s metropolitan division. It also publishes a major Spanish-language newspaper for the entire metro area known as ''La Estrella''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=La Estrella|url=https://www.star-telegram.com/la-estrella/|website=Fort Worth Star-Telegram}}</ref> To the north of Dallas and Fort Worth, the ''[[Denton Record-Chronicle]]'' primarily covers news for the [[Denton, Texas|city of Denton]] and [[Denton County]].

Area television stations affiliated with the major broadcasting networks (network [[Owned-and-operated station|O&O's]] highlighted in '''bold''') include '''[[KDFW|KDFW 4]]''' ([[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]), '''[[KXAS-TV|KXAS 5]]''' ([[NBC]]), [[WFAA-TV|WFAA 8]] ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]) (which for many years was owned by [[Belo Corporation|Belo]] alongside the ''Morning News''), '''[[KTVT|KTVT 11]]''' ([[CBS]]), [[KERA-TV|KERA 13]] ([[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]), '''[[KUVN-TV|KUVN 23]]''' ([[Univisión|UNI]]), '''[[KDFI|KDFI 27]]''' ([[My Network TV|MNTV]]), '''[[KDAF|KDAF 33]]''' ([[The CW]]), and '''[[KXTX-TV|KXTX 39]]''' ([[Telemundo|TMD]]).

[[File:High Five.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=High Five Interchange in Dallas|The [[Central Expressway (Dallas)|Central Expressway]] and I-635 interchange, commonly known as the [[High Five Interchange]]]]
{{Main|Transportation in Dallas}}

Like many other major cities in the United States, the automobile is the primary mode of local transportation, though efforts have been made to increase the availability of alternative modes of transportation, including the construction of light rail lines, biking and walking paths, wide sidewalks, a trolley system, and buses.

In 2009, 78.5% of Dallas (city) commuters drive to work alone. The 2009 [[modal share|mode share]] for Dallas (city) commuters are 10.7% for carpooling, 3.9% for transit, 1.9% for walking, and .1% for cycling.<ref>{{cite web|author=Yonah Freemark|url=https://www.thetransportpolitic.com/2010/10/13/transit-mode-share-trends-looking-steady-rail-appears-to-encourage-non-automobile-commutes/|access-date=October 31, 2017|date= October 13, 2010|title=Transit Mode Share Trends Looking Steady; Rail Appears to Encourage Non-Automobile Commutes|website=Transport Politic}}</ref> In 2015, the American Community Survey estimated modal shares for Dallas (city) commuters of 75.4% for driving alone, 12.8% for carpooling, 3.5% for riding transit, 1.9% for walking, and .2% for cycling.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|series=American Fact Finder|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|access-date=October 31, 2017|title=2015 American Community Survey, 1-year estimates: Commuting Characteristics by Sex}}</ref>

The city of Dallas has a higher than average percentage of households without a car. In 2015, 10.2 percent of Dallas households lacked a car, decreased to 9.1 percent in 2016 and to 8.7 percent in 2023.<ref>{{Cite web |website=United States Census Bureau |title=B08201 Household size by vehicles available |url=https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDT1Y2023.B08201?q=Transportation&g=160XX00US4819000}}</ref> The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016.

===Highways===
Dallas is at the confluence of four major [[interstate highway system|interstate highways]]—Interstates [[Interstate 20 in Texas|20]], [[Interstate 30|30]], [[Interstate 35E (Texas)|35E]], and [[Interstate 45|45]]. The Dallas area freeway system is set up in the popular [[Spoke-hub distribution paradigm|hub-and-spoke]] system, shaped much like a wagon wheel. Starting from the center of the city, a small freeway loop surrounds Downtown, followed by the [[Interstate 635 (Texas)|I-635]] loop about {{convert|10|mi|0}} outside Downtown, and ultimately the tolled [[President George Bush Turnpike]].

Inside these freeway loops are other [[boulevard]]- and [[parkway]]-style loops, including [[Texas State Highway Loop 12|Loop 12]] and [[Belt Line Road (Texas)|Belt Line Road]]. Another beltway around the city upwards of {{convert|45|mi|km|0}} from Downtown is under plan in Collin County.

Radiating out of Downtown Dallas's freeway loop are the spokes of the area's highway system—Interstates 30, 35E, and 45, [[U.S. Route 75 in Texas|US 75]], [[U.S. Route 77 in Texas|US 77]], [[U.S. Route 175|US 175]], [[Texas State Highway Spur 366|SH Spur 366]], the [[Dallas North Tollway]], [[Texas State Highway 114|SH 114]], [[U.S. Route 80 in Texas|US 80]], and [[U.S. Route 67 in Texas|US 67]]. Other major highways around the city include [[Texas State Highway 183|SH 183]] and [[Texas State Highway Spur 408|Spur 408]].

The recently completed interchange at the intersection of Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway ([[Interstate 635 (Texas)|I-635]]) and the [[Central Expressway (Dallas)|Central Expressway]] (US 75) has five stacks and is aptly called the [[High Five Interchange]]. It is one of the few five-level interchanges in Dallas and is one of the largest freeway interchanges in the United States.

The following is a list of the freeways and tollways in the Dallas-Fort Worth area:

===Airports===
[[File:DFWAirportOverview.jpg|thumb|In 2020, [[Dallas Fort Worth International Airport]] was the busiest airport in the world by passenger traffic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cntraveler.com/story/how-dallas-forth-worth-became-the-busiest-airport-in-the-world|title=The Pandemic Has Made This Airport the World's Busiest|date=July 30, 2020|website=Condé Nast Traveler}}</ref>]]
Two commercial airports serve Dallas: [[Dallas Fort Worth International Airport]] and [[Dallas Love Field]]. In addition, [[Dallas Executive Airport]] (formerly Redbird Airport), serves as a [[general aviation]] airport for the city, and [[Addison Airport]] functions similarly just outside the city limits in the suburb of Addison. Two more general aviation airports are about {{convert|35|mi|0}} north of Dallas in [[McKinney, Texas|McKinney]], and another two are in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], on the west side of the metroplex. [[Fort Worth Alliance Airport|Alliance Airport]], in far North Fort Worth, is a cargo reliever airport to DFW Airport and general aviation facility.

DFW Airport is in the suburbs slightly north of and equidistant to Downtown Fort Worth and Downtown Dallas. In terms of size, DFW International is the largest airport in the state, the second largest in the United States, and ninth largest in the world; DFW International Airport is larger than the island of [[Manhattan]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=DIA is the second biggest airport in the world, and that means it's bigger than Manhattan|url=https://www.9news.com/article/travel/denver-international-airport/how-big-is-dia-denver-airport/73-01b2cee0-03c4-4317-9e55-dd0537cf2239|access-date=June 29, 2020|website=KUSA.com|date=February 21, 2020 |language=en-US}}</ref>

In terms of traffic, DFW Airport is the [[List of airports in Texas#Busiest Texan airports|busiest airport in the state]], [[List of the busiest airports in the United States|fourth-busiest in the United States]], and [[List of the busiest airports|eleventh-busiest in the world]]. The headquarters of [[American Airlines]], the largest air carrier in the world ahead of [[United Airlines]] and [[Delta Air Lines]], is less than {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} from DFW Airport within Fort Worth's city limits. Similarly, Love Field is within Dallas's city limits, about {{convert|6|mi|0}} northwest of Downtown, and is headquarters to [[Southwest Airlines]], the largest domestic airline in the United States.

[[Dallas Area Rapid Transit]] (DART) is the Dallas-area public transportation authority that provides rail, buses and [[HOV]] lanes to commuters. DART began operating the first [[light rail]] system in Texas in 1996, and it is now the largest operator of light rail in the US.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://irvingblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2010/12/dart-becomes-nations-largest-l.html |title=DART becomes nation's largest light rail system today &#124; Irving Blog |publisher=Irvingblog.dallasnews.com |date=December 6, 2010 |access-date=May 11, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323110609/http://irvingblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2010/12/dart-becomes-nations-largest-l.html |archive-date=March 23, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Today, the system is the [[List of United States light rail systems by ridership|seventh-busiest]] light rail system in the country with approximately 55 stations on {{convert|72|mi}} of light rail, and 10 stations on {{convert|35|mi}} of commuter rail.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dart.org/about/expansion/otherprojects.asp|title=DART.org – Expansion Information|website=dart.org|access-date=August 27, 2017}}</ref> It includes four light rail lines and a commuter line: the {{DART R}}, the {{DART B}}, the {{DART G}}, the {{DART O}}, and the {{DART TRE}}.

The {{DART R}} travels through [[Oak Cliff]], [[South Dallas]], [[downtown Dallas|Downtown]], [[Uptown Dallas|Uptown]], [[North Dallas]], [[Richardson, Texas|Richardson]] and [[Plano, Texas|Plano]], while the {{DART B}} goes through Oak Cliff, Downtown, Uptown, [[East Dallas]], [[Lake Highlands]], and [[Garland, Texas|Garland]]. The {{DART R|style=nl}} and {{DART B|style=nl}} lines are conjoined between [[8th & Corinth Station]] in Oak Cliff through [[Mockingbird Station]] in [[North Dallas]]. The two lines service [[Cityplace Station]]. The Green Line serves [[Carrollton, Texas|Carrollton]], [[Farmers Branch, Texas|Farmers Branch]], [[Dallas Love Field|Love Field Airport]], [[Stemmons Corridor, Dallas, Texas|Stemmons Corridor]], [[Victory Park, Dallas, Texas|Victory Park]], Downtown, [[Deep Ellum, Dallas, Texas|Deep Ellum]], [[Fair Park]], South Dallas, and [[Pleasant Grove, Dallas|Pleasant Grove]].

The Orange Line initially operated as a peak-service line providing extra capacity on portions of the Green and Red Lines ([[Bachman Station]] on the Green Line, through the Downtown transit mall, to [[Parker Road Station]] on the Red Line making a "U"-shape). However, the first stage of the Orange Line opened on December 6, 2010, extending its west end from Bachman to [[Belt Line Station]] in Irving. The second and final phase opened in August 2014 and provided [[Dallas–Fort Worth International Airport|DFW Airport]] with rail service. [[DFW Airport Terminal A station]] is the terminus for the Orange Line and connects [[DFW Skylink|Skylink]].<ref name="dart.org">{{cite web|url=https://dart.org/about/expansion/orangeline.asp |title=Orange Line Expansion Information |publisher=DART.org |access-date=May 11, 2013}}</ref>

This provides passengers the convenience of disembarking the DART rail, proceeding to security check-in and immediately boarding [[DFW Skylink|Skylink]] to be quickly transported to their desired terminal. The Blue Line has also been extended by {{convert|4.5|mi}} to serve [[Rowlett, Texas|Rowlett]] at the [[Rowlett Park & Ride]] facility.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dart.org/about/expansion/blueline.asp |title=Blue Line Expansion Information |publisher=DART.org |access-date=May 11, 2013}}</ref>

In August 2009, the Regional Transportation Council agreed to seek $96&nbsp;million in federal stimulus dollars for a trolley project in Dallas and Fort Worth.

In 2008, Chopra starred opposite [[Harman Baweja]] in [[Harry Baweja|his father's]] ''[[Love Story 2050]]''.

The string of poorly received films ended when Chopra starred in [[Madhur Bhandarkar]]'s ''[[Fashion (2008 film)|Fashion]]'', a drama about the Indian fashion industry which followed the lives and careers of several fashion models.

=== Writing ===
Chopra began writing an opinion column for the ''Hindustan Times'' in 2009. She wrote a total of 50 columns for the newspaper. She said after her first year of writing: "I'm a private person and never thought that I could express my feelings. But strangely enough, whenever I sat down to write this column, my inner most thoughts came to the fore."<ref>{{cite news |title=Priyanka Chopra turns 50 |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Lifestyle/CelebWatch/Priyanka-Chopra-turns-50/Article1-512840.aspx |work=Hindustan Times |author=Chopra, Priyanka |date=26 February 2010 |access-date=5 September 2012 |archive-date=19 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819000208/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Lifestyle/CelebWatch/Priyanka-Chopra-turns-50/Article1-512840.aspx |url-status=dead}}</ref> In March 2009, she met several readers who had submitted feedback on her weekly column.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hi, it's Priyanka |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/Entertainment/Hi-it-s-Priyanka/Article1-388701.aspx |work=Hindustan Times |author=Neha Sharma and Garima Sharma |date=12 March 2009 |access-date=5 September 2012 |archive-date=13 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513065918/http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/Entertainment/Hi-it-s-Priyanka/Article1-388701.aspx |url-status=dead}}</ref> She continued to write sporadically for newspapers.

Later that year, Chopra wrote an op-ed for ''[[The New York Times]]'' titled "What [[Jane Austen]] Knew" about the importance of education for girls.

[[Rock music|Rock]] and pop music remained roughly synonymous until the late 1960s, after which ''pop'' became associated with music that was more commercial, [[wikt:ephemeral|ephemeral]], and accessible.

Identifying factors of pop music usually include repeated choruses and [[Hook (music)|hooks]], short to medium-length songs written in a basic format (often the [[verse–chorus form|verse–chorus structure]]), and rhythms or tempos that can be easily danced to. Much of pop music also borrows elements from other styles such as [[Rock music|rock]], [[hip hop]], [[urban contemporary|urban]], [[dance music|dance]], [[Latin music|Latin]], and [[country music|country]].

The terms ''popular music'' and ''pop music'' are often used interchangeably, as the former also describes ''all'' music that is targeted for mass appeal (compare [[art music]]) and includes many disparate styles.

==Definitions and etymology{{anchor|Etymology}}==
[[David Hatch]] and Stephen Millward describe pop music as "a body of music which is distinguishable from popular, jazz, and folk music".<ref>D. Hatch and S. Millward, ''[[iarchive:frombluestorocka0000hatc|From Blues to Rock: an Analytical History of Pop Music]]'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1987), {{ISBN|0-7190-1489-1}}, p. 1.</ref>
David Boyle, a music researcher, states pop music as any type of music that a person has been exposed to by the mass media.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Boyle|first1=J.

As a genre, pop music is seen to exist and develop separately.<ref>R. Serge Denisoff and William L.

Pop music evolves along with the term's definition. According to music writer Bill Lamb, popular music is defined as "the music since industrialization in the 1800s that is most in line with the tastes and interests of the urban middle class."<ref name="What Is Pop Music">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-pop-music-3246980|title=What Is Pop Music?|last=Lamb|first=Bill|website=ThoughtCo.|date=29 September 2018|access-date=4 November 2018|archive-date=17 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190417032933/https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-pop-music-3246980|url-status=live}}</ref> The term "pop song" was first used in 1926, in the sense of a piece of music "having popular appeal".<ref name="OED">J.

According to the website of ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', the term "pop music" "originated in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in the mid-1950s as a description for [[rock and roll]] and the new youth music styles that it influenced".<ref name=Grove>R.

From about 1967, the term "pop music" was increasingly used in opposition to the term rock music, a division that gave generic significance to both terms.<ref name="Gloag983">Kenneth Gloag in ''[[iarchive:isbn 9780198662129|The Oxford Companion to Music]]'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-19-866212-2}}, p. 983.</ref> While rock aspired to [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] and an expansion of the possibilities of popular music,<ref name=Gloag983/> pop was more commercial, ephemeral, and accessible.<ref name="Warner2003">T.

Frith adds that it is "not driven by any significant ambition except profit and commercial reward ... and, in musical terms, it is essentially conservative". It is "provided from on high (by record companies, radio programmers, and concert promoters) rather than being made from below.&nbsp;...

According to Frith, characteristics of pop music include an aim of appealing to a general audience, rather than to a particular sub-culture or ideology, and an emphasis on craftsmanship rather than formal "artistic" qualities.<ref name=Firth2001/> Besides, Frith also offers three identifying characteristics of pop music: light entertainment, commercial imperatives, and personal identification. Pop music grew out of a light entertainment and [[easy listening]] tradition.<ref name=Rojek2to3>{{Cite book|last=Rojek|first=Chris|title=Pop music, pop culture|publisher=Polity; 1st edition (June 13, 2011)|year=2011|isbn=978-0745642642|pages=2–3}}</ref> Pop music is more conservative than other music genres such as folk, blues, country, and tradition. Many pop songs do not contain themes of resistance, opposition, or politics, rather focusing more on love and relationships.  Therefore, pop music does not challenge its audiences socially, and does not cause political activism. Frith also said the main purpose of pop music is to create revenue. It is not a medium of free articulation of the people. Instead, pop music seeks to achieve the instant empathy with cliche personalities, stereotypes, and melodrama that appeals to listeners.<ref name=Rojek2to3 /> Music scholar Timothy Warner said pop music typically has an emphasis on recording, production, and technology, rather than live performance; a tendency to reflect existing trends rather than [[progressive music|progressive developments]]; and seeks to encourage dancing or uses dance-oriented rhythms.<ref name=Warner2003/>

The main medium of pop music is the song, often between two and a half and three and a half minutes in length, generally marked by a consistent and noticeable [[rhythm|rhythmic element]], a mainstream style and a simple traditional [[song structure (popular music)|structure]].<ref>W. Everett, ''Expression in Pop-rock Music: A Collection of Critical and Analytical Essays'' (London: Taylor & Francis, 2000), p. 272.</ref> The structure of many popular songs is that of a verse and a chorus, the chorus serving as the portion of the track that is designed to stick in the ear through simple repetition both musically and lyrically. The chorus is often where the music builds towards and is often preceded by "the drop" where the bass and drum parts "drop out".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cmuse.org/characteristics-of-pop-music|title=Characteristics of Pop Music: An Introduction|access-date=2020-07-07|website=Cmuse.org|date=9 December 2019|archive-date=2020-07-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200708195748/https://www.cmuse.org/characteristics-of-pop-music|url-status=live}}</ref> Common variants include the verse-chorus form and the [[thirty-two-bar form]], with a focus on [[melody|melodies]] and catchy [[hook (music)|hooks]], and a [[refrain|chorus]] that contrasts melodically, rhythmically and [[harmony|harmonically]] with the [[Verse (music)|verse]].<ref>J. Shepherd, ''Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World: Performance and production'' (Continuum, 2003), p. 508.</ref> The beat and the melodies tend to be simple, with limited harmonic accompaniment.<ref>V. Kramarz, ''The Pop Formulas: Harmonic Tools of the Hit Makers'' (Mel Bay Publications, 2007), p. 61.</ref> The lyrics of modern pop songs typically focus on simple themes&nbsp;– often love and romantic relationships&nbsp;– although there are notable exceptions.<ref name=Firth2001/>

[[Harmony (music)|Harmony]] and [[chord progression]]s in pop music are often "that of [[Classical music|classical]] European [[tonality]], only more simple-minded."<ref>Winkler, Peter (1978). "Toward a theory of pop harmony", ''In Theory Only'', 4, pp.&nbsp;3–26.</ref> Clichés include the [[close and open harmony|barbershop quartet-style harmony]] (i.e. ii – V – I) and [[blues scale]]-influenced harmony.<ref>Sargeant, p. 198. cited in Winkler (1978), p. 4.</ref> There was a lessening of the influence of traditional views of the [[circle of fifths]] between the mid-1950s and the late 1970s, including less predominance for the [[dominant (music)|dominant]] [[diatonic function|function]].<ref>Winkler (1978), p. 22.</ref>

In October 2023, [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] compiled a list of "the 500 best pop songs". In doing so, they noted the difficulty of defining "pop songs":
{{blockquote|One of the reasons pop can be hard to summarize is because there’s no real sonic or musical definition to it.

In the 1940s, improved [[microphone]] design allowed a more intimate singing style and, ten or twenty years later, inexpensive and more durable 45 rpm records for singles "revolutionized the manner in which pop has been disseminated", which helped to move pop music to "a record/radio/film star system".<ref name="Buckley">D. Buckley, "Pop" "II. Implications of technology", ''Grove Music Online'', retrieved 15 March 2010.</ref> Another technological change was the widespread availability of television in the 1950s with televised performances, which meant that "pop stars had to have a visual presence".<ref name="Buckley" /> In the 1960s, the introduction of inexpensive, portable [[transistor radio]]s meant that teenagers in the developed world could listen to music outside of the home.<ref name="Buckley" /> By the early 1980s, the promotion of pop music had been greatly affected by the rise of music television channels like [[MTV]], which "favoured those artists such as [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Madonna]] who had a strong visual appeal".<ref name="Buckley" />

[[Multi-track recording]] (from the 1960s) and [[sampling (music)|digital sampling]] (from the 1980s) have also been used as methods for the creation and elaboration of pop music.<ref name=Firth2001/> During the mid-1960s, pop music made repeated forays into new sounds, styles, and techniques that inspired public discourse among its listeners. The word "progressive" was frequently used, and it was thought that every song and single was to be a "progression" from the last.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hewitt|first1=Paolo|last2=Hellier|first2=John|title=Steve Marriott: All Too Beautiful|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CxhzCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT162|year=2015|publisher=Dean Street Press|isbn=978-1-910570-69-2|page=162}}</ref> Music critic [[Simon Reynolds]] writes that beginning with 1967, a divide would exist between "progressive" pop and "mass/chart" pop, a separation which was "also, broadly, one between boys and girls, middle-class and working-class."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Simon|author-link=Simon Reynolds|title=On Record: Rock, Pop and the Written Word|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lauJAgAAQBAJ|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-93951-0|chapter=New Pop and its Aftermath|page=398}}</ref>

===Stylistic evolution===
[[File:The Beatles arrive at JFK Airport.jpg|thumb|left|The 1960s [[British Invasion]] marked a period when the US charts were inundated with British acts such as [[the Beatles]] (pictured 1964).]]

Throughout its development, pop music has absorbed influences from other genres of popular music. Early pop music drew on [[traditional pop]], an American counterpart to German [[Schlager music|Schlager]] and French [[Chanson]], however compared to the pop of European countries, traditional pop originally emphasized influences ranging from [[Tin Pan Alley]] songwriting, [[Broadway theatre]], and [[show tune]]s. As the genre evolved more influences ranging from [[Classical music|classical]], [[Folk music|folk]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[Country music|country]], [[electronic music]], and other popular genres became more prominent. In 2016, a ''[[Scientific Reports]]'' study that examined over 464,000 recordings of popular music recorded between 1955 and 2010 found that, compared to 1960s pop music, contemporary pop music uses a smaller variety of pitch progressions, greater average volume,<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/srep00521|pmid=22837813|pmc=3405292|title=Measuring the Evolution of Contemporary Western Popular Music|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=2|article-number=521|year=2012|last1=Serrà|first1=Joan|last2=Corral|first2=Álvaro|last3=Boguñá|first3=Marián|last4=Haro|first4=Martín|last5=Arcos|first5=Josep Ll.|arxiv=1205.5651|bibcode=2012NatSR...2..521S| issn=2045-2322}}</ref> less diverse instrumentation and recording techniques, and less timbral variety.<ref name="Matson"/> ''[[Scientific American]]''{{'}}s John Matson reported that this "seems to support the popular anecdotal observation that pop music of yore was "better", or at least more varied, than today's top-40 stuff".

According to ''[[Grove Music Online]]'', "Western-derived pop styles, whether coexisting with or marginalizing distinctively local genres, have spread throughout the world and have come to constitute stylistic common denominators in global commercial music cultures".<ref name=PManuel>P.

At the beginning of the 2000s, the trends that dominated during the late 1990s still continued, but the music industry started to change as people began to download music from the internet. People were able to discover genres and artists that were outside of the mainstream and propel them to fame, but at the same time smaller artists had a harder time making a living because their music was being pirated.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ghoshal |first=Abhimanyu |date=2018-12-28 |title=A nostalgic look back at digital music piracy in the 2000s |url=https://thenextweb.com/news/a-nostalgic-look-back-at-digital-music-piracy-in-the-2000s |access-date=2022-07-27 |website=TNW |archive-date=2022-07-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220727213750/https://thenextweb.com/news/a-nostalgic-look-back-at-digital-music-piracy-in-the-2000s |url-status=live }}</ref> Popular artists were [[Avril Lavigne]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[NSYNC]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Destiny's Child]], and [[Britney Spears]]. Pop music often came from many different genres, with each genre in turn influencing the next one, blurring the lines between them and making them less distinct. This change was epitomized in Spears' highly influential 2007 album ''[[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]'', which under the influence of producer [[Danja (record producer)|Danja]], mixed the sounds of [[Electronic dance music|EDM]], [[avant-funk]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[dance music]], and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hova |first=Tray |date=2011-02-07 |title=Studio Stories: Danja [Pg. 2] |url=https://www.vibe.com/news/entertainment/studio-stories-danja-pg-2-44595/ |access-date=2022-07-27 |website=VIBE.com |archive-date=2022-07-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220727213752/https://www.vibe.com/news/entertainment/studio-stories-danja-pg-2-44595/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

By 2010, pop music impacted by dance music came to be dominant on the charts. Instead of radio setting the trends, it was now the club.

Much [[Pop music|pop]] and rock music has been very similar in sound, instrumentation and even lyrical content. The terms "pop rock" and "[[power pop]]" have been used to describe more commercially successful music that uses elements from, or the form of, rock music.<ref>R.

Starr and C.

The term "pop" has been used since the early 1940s to refer to popular music in general, but in the mid-1950s, it began to be used for a distinct genre, aimed at a youth market, often characterized as a softer alternative to rock and roll.<ref name="Firth2001">S.

==Debates==
{{See also|Rockism and poptimism}}
Critic Philip Auslander argues that the distinction between pop and rock is more pronounced in the US than in the UK. He claims that in the US, pop has roots in white [[crooners]] such as [[Perry Como]], whereas rock is rooted in [[African-American music]] influenced by forms such as [[rock and roll]]. Auslander points out that the concept of pop rock, which blends pop and rock, is at odds with the typical conception of pop and rock as opposites. Auslander and several other scholars, such as [[Simon Frith]] and Grossberg, argue that pop music is often depicted as an inauthentic, cynical, "slickly commercial", and formulaic form of entertainment. In contrast, rock music is often heralded as an authentic, sincere, and anti-commercial form of music, which emphasizes songwriting by the singers and bands and instrumental virtuosity.<ref>P. Auslander (1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=jXCTAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA66&dq= ''Liveness: Performance in a Mediatized Culture''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180910133006/https://books.google.com/books?id=jXCTAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA66&dq= |date=2018-09-10 }} (London: Taylor & Francis), {{ISBN|0415196892}}.</ref>

Frith's analysis of the history of popular music from the 1950s to the 1980s has been criticized by B. J. Moore-Gilbert, who argues that Frith and other scholars have overemphasized the role of rock in the history of popular music by naming every new genre using the "rock" suffix. Thus, when a [[Folk music|folk]]-oriented style of music developed in the 1960s, Frith termed it "[[folk rock]]", and the pop-infused styles of the 1970s were called "pop rock". Moore-Gilbert claims that this approach unfairly puts rock at the apex and makes every other influence become an add-on to the central core of rock.<ref>B. J. Moore-Gilbert, ''The Arts in the 1970s: Cultural Closure?'' (London: Routledge, 1994), {{ISBN|0-415-09906-4}}, p. 240.</ref>

In ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981), [[Robert Christgau]] discussed the term "pop-rock" in the context of popular music's fragmentation along stylistic lines in the 1970s; he regarded "pop-rock" as a "monolith" that "straddled" all burgeoning movements and subgenres in the popular and [[semipopular music]] marketplace at the time, including [[singer-songwriter]] music, [[art rock]], [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[boogie rock|boogie]], [[country rock]], [[jazz fusion]], [[funk]], [[disco]], [[Urban contemporary music|urban contemporary]], and [[new wave music|new wave]], but not [[punk rock]].<ref name="CG">{{Cite book |last=Christgau |first=Robert |title=[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]] |publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]] |year=1981 |isbn=0899190251 |chapter=The Decade |author-link=Robert Christgau |access-date=April 6, 2019 |chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/bk-cg70/decade.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402183403/http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/bk-cg70/decade.php |archive-date=April 2, 2019 |url-status=live |via=robertchristgau.com}}</ref>

== History==
=== 1950s: Pre-pop rock===
In the mid-to-late 1950s, the music scenes in the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] were both similar and different. Similar genres of music were present, in the forms of pop and rock, but different artists were present, accounting for the lack of a 'universal style of music'. Artists may have had hits in both countries, such as [[Elvis Presley]],<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/13107/elvis-presley/ | title=Elvis Presley | website=[[Official Charts Company|Official Charts]] }}</ref> but that was in the minority of instances.

In the United States, artists that gained popularity often came from [[blues]] influences, such as [[Chuck Berry]],<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.chartsinfrance.net/Chuck-Berry/The-Original-Sound-Of-R-b-1959-a113847792.html | title=Chuck Berry - the Original Sound of R&b 1959 }}</ref> or [[Little Richard]], or [[Country music|country]] influences in the forms of [[rock and roll]] or [[rockabilly]], such as Presley.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.countrymusichalloffame.org/hall-of-fame/elvis-presley | title=Elvis Presley }}</ref>

In Britain, these influences often extended to the music scene there, with artists such as [[Cliff Richard]] having had rock and roll hits such as "[[Move It]]"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.skidmore.edu/music/courses/britsong/moveit.php | title=Move It }}</ref> or [[Tommy Steele]] having been a [[teen idol]] influenced by Presley. These were a form of rock which eventually, through a build-up of influences, led to the advent of pop rock as the next decade rolled in. [[File:Cliff Richard 924-3978 (crop).jpg | thumb|right |[[Cliff Richard]]]]

===Early 1960s: "I Want to Hold Your Hand" and the British Invasion===
By the time the early 1960s had rolled around, rock music was falling in prominence. Pop artists continued gaining province with [[dance crazes]], and rock artists began to lose prominence with Presley being drafted to the army.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://unwritten-record.blogs.archives.gov/2022/08/02/sergeant-presley-photographs-of-elvis-time-with-the-army/ | title=Sergeant Presley: Photographs of Elvis' Time with the Army | date=2 August 2022 }}</ref> However, rock music was soon to regain province due to an up-and-coming music science based out of England, [[Beat music|Merseybeat]]. Merseybeat was influenced by the genres of [[skiffle]] and rock and roll, and artists began to take up the genre.

The music scenes between the United States and the United Kingdom truly became close in 1964. [[The Beatles]], a group from the Merseybeat scene, had already gained success in the United Kingdom with hit singles like "[[Love Me Do]]".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.officialcharts.com/songs/the-beatles-love-me-do/ | title=Love Me do | website=[[Official Charts Company|Official Charts]] }}</ref> However, they did not gain popularity in the United States until the release of the song "[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]". The song gained over a million advance orders in the United Kingdom, and in early 1964 entered the United States ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts.

The [[British Invasion]] then started shortly afterward, with the Beatles' appearance on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', which only proceeded to solidify their popularity. An era known as [[Beatlemania]] then started.<ref>{{Cite web | title=Beatlemania - Museum of Youth Culture | url=https://www.museumofyouthculture.com/beatlemania/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200809192228/https://museumofyouthculture.com/beatlemania/ | access-date=2025-08-04 | archive-date=2020-08-09}}</ref> This was among the first times that the United States and United Kingdom's music scenes had a similar mega-hit, and rock music re-broke into the mainstream. [[File:Aankomst Beatles op Schiphol, overzicht drukte op Schiphol, Bestanddeelnr 916-5134.jpg | thumb|right | The Beatles being bombarded in the Netherlands]]

Other artists continued to follow after the Beatles in the British Invasion. Non-pop rock oriented bands gained success, such as [[the Rolling Stones]], [[the Animals]], and [[Manfred Mann]], but other similarly styled Merseybeat bands continued to gain success during the British Invasion, such as [[the Dave Clark Five]],<ref>{{cite web | url=https://chart-history.net/dave-clark/ | title=Dave-clark – Chart-History }}</ref> who followed the Beatles, and had almost equal American success to that they had in Britain.

Over in the United States, less pop rock artists gained major success, with the former [[surf music]] scene which had much popularity in the earlier 1960s losing all major prominence with the Beatles gaining success. The only artist from that genre to make a continuous mainstream impact was [[the Beach Boys]], who successfully incorporated elements of pop rock into their music.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://utpress.utexas.edu/9781477318720/ | title=Why the Beach Boys Matter }}</ref>[[File:Beach Boys 1963.jpg | thumb|right |[[The Beach Boys]]]]

===Mid–late 1960s: Shift to counterculture===
As the middle and late 1960s came along, a shift to [[counterculture]] music gained momentum. Popular artists like the Beatles shifted to sounds inspired by [[folk rock]], and later [[psychedelic rock]]. The Beatles later returned to pop rock before breaking up, all while having major hits. The Beach Boys followed a similar path, eventually opting for a more symphonic path and having the critically acclaimed ''[[Pet Sounds]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9371-pet-sounds-40th-anniversary/ | title=The Beach Boys: Pet Sounds: 40th Anniversary | website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] }}</ref>

Younger audiences, especially teenagers, felt a longing for the pop rock artists and style of the past with the artists which were popular having had major stylistic shifts. Out of the artists who emerged in this void, [[the Monkees]] gained the most success. They were a made-for-TV band,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060010/ | title=The Monkees | website=[[IMDb]] }}</ref> who had major success with a number of hits. They later underwent similar stylistic shifts to the Beatles before breaking up. [[File:The Monkees 1966.JPG | thumb|right |[[The Monkees]]]]

Other artists pursued pop rock related sounds in the form of [[fusion genre]]s, combining those sounds with other genres. These artists included [[the Turtles]], [[the Mamas and the Papas]], who pursued a folk-rock related sound,<ref>{{Cite web | title=Home - The Mamas & The Papas | url=https://www.themamasandthepapasofficial.com | access-date=2025-08-04 | website=www.themamasandthepapasofficial.com}}</ref> and [[the Zombies]], who opted for [[symphonic rock]].

As the decade came to a close, pop rock was no longer as dominant, but still an important genre. However, as [[hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Led-Zeppelin | title=Led Zeppelin &#124; British Rock Band, Hard Rock, Blues Rock &#124; Britannica }}</ref> gained success, and [[progressive rock]] gained respect as an underground genre, the genre gradually would begin a shift into [[soft rock]]-related territory.

===1970s===
As the decade rolled in, the most major event was the [[breakup of the Beatles]]. Despite continuing commercial success, internal tensions caused a breakup. All four members continued to have successful careers. [[Ringo Starr]] was the least successful of them, but still topped charts.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.officialcharts.com/songs/ringo-starr-photograph/ | title=Photograph | website=[[Official Charts Company|Official Charts]] }}</ref> [[George Harrison]] pursued a more [[Spiritual music|spiritual]]-inspired pop rock genre, yet had multiple hits for over a decade and had extreme influence.

[[John Lennon]] also had a large amount of success. With his work with his wife [[Yoko Ono]], solo work, and work with his band, the [[Plastic Ono Band]], Lennon continued to have chart-topping hits in both the United States and the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.officialcharts.com/songs/john-lennon-imagine/ | title=Imagine | website=[[Official Charts Company|Official Charts]] }}</ref> Lennon's career was cut short due to his [[Death of John Lennon|death due to murder in 1980]], but his memory and influence lives on.

However, out of all the Beatles, the member who pursued the purest pop rock sound and became one of the defining artists of the genre was [[Paul McCartney]]. Despite starting off his solo career with the [[lo-fi]] album ''[[McCartney (album)|McCartney]]'', he soon formed the band [[Paul McCartney and Wings|Wings]] with his wife [[Linda McCartney]] and former symphonic rock and [[Moody Blues]] guitarist [[Denny Laine]]. The band had a number of major hits such as "[[Live and Let Die (song)|Live and Let Die]]", "[[Mull of Kintyre (song)|Mull of Kintyre]]", and "[[Band on the Run (song)|Band on the Run]]". Wings continued its success for slightly under a decade before breaking up. [[File:Paul McCartney with Jimmy McCulloch - Wings - 1976.jpg | thumb|right | Paul McCartney in Wings]]

Also, pop rock and soft rock continued to have artists falling under both genres. One of the most prominent artists to do this was [[Elton John]], a British singer-songwriter and pianist. He had a string of chart-topping albums<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9w8g7jlkpwo | title=Sir Elton John celebrates 'extraordinary' 10th UK number one album | date=April 11, 2025 }}</ref> combining influences from both genres, along with others such as [[glam rock]]. John's success was so big that he is amongst the most streamed rock artists of all time. Another major artist with a similar level of success, albeit slightly less so than Elton John is [[Billy Joel]]. While Elton John was British, Joel was an American pianist and singer-songwriter. He first experienced success with his hit "[[Piano Man (song)|Piano Man]]", and skyrocketed to success with ''[[The Stranger (album)|The Stranger]]'', a 1977 album. Both artists have had continuous long lasting success to modern times. [[File:Elton John in 1971.jpg | thumb|right | [[Elton John]] pictured in 1971]]

Arguably one of the most influential albums of all time, and of the pop rock genre, was ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]'' by British rock band [[Fleetwood Mac]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://bestsellingalbums.org/overall/ | title=Best-selling albums of all time }}</ref> Fleetwood Mac started off as a [[blues rock]] group but found their footing in the pop rock genre and became a major artist due to a string of hit songs such as "[[Dreams (Fleetwood Mac song)|Dreams]]", "[[Go Your Own Way]]", and "[[Don't Stop (Fleetwood Mac song)|Don't Stop]]".[[File:Fleetwood Mac (1977).jpg | thumb|right |[[Fleetwood Mac]]]]

A related genre to pop rock, dubbed [[arena rock]], also began gaining prominence. Three of the major artists of the genre, [[Styx (band)|Styx]],<ref>{{cite web | url=https://styxworld.com/blogs/news/the-grand-illusion-turns-43-today | title=The Grand Illusion Turns 43 Today! &#124; News | date=7 July 2020 }}</ref> [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]],<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rhino.com/article/foreigner-detail-new-greatest-hits-collection-turning-back-the-time | title=Foreigner Detail New Greatest Hits Collection TURNING BACK THE TIME }}</ref> and [[Boston (band)|Boston]]<ref>{{cite web | url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/boston-first-album/ | title=The Story of Boston's Blockbuster Debut Album | date=25 August 2016 }}</ref> had large success with their albums ''[[The Grand Illusion]]'', ''[[Foreigner (Foreigner album)|Foreigner]]'', and ''[[Boston (album)|Boston]]'' respectively, all of which sold very well.

During this decade, mega-hit albums were of abundance, like ''The Stranger'', ''Rumours'', and ''[[Breakfast in America]]''. However, as the decade came to a close, changes in the music scene such as the advent of [[punk rock]] and [[New wave music|new wave]] would change pop rock and its style as it continued to adapt in order to survive.

===1980s: New wave, synth-pop, and glam metal===
As the 1980s rolled in, a new style of music was gaining prominence. This style of music was [[synth-pop]]. The genre combined punk rock influences and pop music<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.masterclass.com/articles/synth-pop-music-guide | title=Synth-Pop Music Guide: A Brief History of Synth-Pop - 2025 }}</ref> in a new context, with instrumentation led by the [[synthesizer]]. Many synth-pop duos and groups are considerable in the pantheon of pop rock music, such as but not limited to [[the Human League]], [[Icehouse (band)|Icehouse]], and [[Tears for Fears]], who once again brought a form of pop rock to the mainstream, despite differences from music of the past.

New wave was another similar style of music to synth-pop, except in a fully rock context,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.masterclass.com/articles/new-wave-music-guide | title=New Wave Music: The History and Bands of New Wave Music - 2025 }}</ref> with similar influences to that of synth-pop. Major artists which released hits in a new wave setting included [[Duran Duran]],<ref>{{cite web | url=https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/duran-duran | title=Duran Duran discography - RYM/Sonemic }}</ref> [[Culture Club]], and [[INXS]].[[File:Duran Duran.jpg | thumb|right |[[Duran Duran]]]]

Amongst the biggest pop rock groups of the 1980s was [[the Police]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2023/06/40-years-ago-the-police-exit-with-a-classic/ | title=40 Years Ago: The Police Exit with a Classic | date=19 June 2023 }}</ref> From the late 1970s to the early 1980s, the band released a number of huge hits which continued the momentum of rock music, such as "[[Every Breath You Take]]" and "[[Message in a Bottle (The Police song)|Message in a Bottle]]". However, they broke up after being dubbed "the biggest band in the world", and left a void. [[File:The Police 02.jpg | thumb|right | [[The Police]] vocalist [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]]]

Women also had a major role in pop rock music that often goes unlooked at. All-female pop rock groups gained success, such as [[the Go-Go's]], and by extension lead singer [[Belinda Carlisle]], and [[the Bangles]]. Co-lead singer of Fleetwood Mac, [[Stevie Nicks]],<ref>{{cite web | url=https://musicchartsarchive.com/artists/stevie-nicks | title=Stevie Nicks | date=29 April 2016 }}</ref> also enjoyed a long and successful pop rock career.

A subgenre of heavy metal music, [[glam metal]], gained success in the later part of the decade. Glam metal appealed to both genders, and gained success due to a widespread audience. Bands like [[Def Leppard]],<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/def-leppard/ | title=Def Leppard &#124; Biography, Music & News | magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] }}</ref> [[Europe (band)|Europe]], and [[Bon Jovi]]<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/bon-jovi/ | title=Bon Jovi &#124; Biography, Music & News | magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] }}</ref> had major chart successes, with Bon Jovi in particular being a mainstay of the charts until the 2000s. However, while the 1990s rolled in, the glam metal scene fell as quickly as it had risen as new genres took its place. [[File:Bon Jovi 1.jpg | thumb|right | [[Bon Jovi]]]]

===1990s: Britpop and pop-punk===
Traditional pop rock had fallen as the advent of [[grunge]] occurred. Grunge was a heavy<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.masterclass.com/articles/grunge-music-guide | title=Grunge Music Guide: 4 Characteristics of Grunge Music - 2025 }}</ref> style of music based out of the [[Seattle]] music scene, consisting of punk rock and heavy metal influences. However, grunge itself, similarly to its influences, was not a form of pop rock music.

In the United Kingdom, grunge did not catch on with the population, who decided to explore the concept of [[Cool Britannia]], and a new genre of music rose to prominence. This genre was [[Britpop]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.guitarworld.com/features/the-rise-and-fall-of-britpop | title="Forget grunge music. Get a pint of Guinness down your neck and pick that guitar up": The rise and fall of Britpop, the Nineties' other massive guitar movement | date=13 November 2023 }}</ref> Britpop was a genre of music containing lyrics inspired by the United Kingdom and influenced by pop rock bands like the Beatles. Britpop did not gain mainstream success in the United States, but significantly impacted the British music scene. However, some Britpop songs did become hits in the US by bands such as [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Elastica]] and [[the Verve]].

The [[battle of Britpop]]<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.radiox.co.uk/artists/oasis/inside-britpops-biggest-battle-blur-vs-oasis/ | title=Blur Vs Oasis: The true story of the Battle of Britpop }}</ref> was a rivalry in the United Kingdom between bands [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] and [[Blur (band)|Blur]]. Blur won in the short run, but Oasis had longer lasting influence. Both bands, along with [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]], [[Suede (band)|Suede]], and [[Supergrass]] experienced major success in the United Kingdom. [[File:Oasis Noel and Liam WF.jpg | thumb|right |[[Oasis (band)|Oasis]]]]

However, in the United States another genre emerged. This genre was dubbed [[pop-punk]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.soundoflife.com/blogs/mixtape/history-of-pop-punk | title=Learn About the History of Pop Punk, a Music Genre Loved the World over &#124; Sound of Life &#124; Powered by KEF }}</ref> Pop punk was a fusion genre between the genres of pop rock and punk rock, which gained success in the mid-1990s.

Pop-punk had many important bands which contributed to its success, such as [[Green Day]],<ref>{{cite web | url=https://greenday.fm/charts/album-sales/ | title=Album Sales }}</ref> [[Blink-182]], and many others, who oftentimes worked in a [[power trio]] format. Despite Britpop ending up falling in the late 1990s due to commercial failure and stylistic shifts, pop-punk lived on much longer. [[File:Green Day - Hella Mega Tour - August 10, 2021 (cropped).jpg | thumb|right | [[Green Day]]]]

===2000s: Post-Britpop and more styles===
By the time the new millennium rolled in, Britpop had already declined commercially.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-66186676 | title=Britpop: What prompted the end of the genre that gave us Blur and Pulp? | date=15 July 2023 }}</ref> Despite pop-punk's continued success, other genres took its place in terms of commercial success. However, this decade also experienced a loss of commercial success for rock,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.schoolofrock.com/locations/buford/news/in-the-press/rock-and-roll-is-dead | title=Rock and Roll is Dead? | date=March 2020 }}</ref> but many artists still experienced success.

One of the many genres to emerge was [[post-Britpop]]. Post-Britpop explored Britpop music in a typically softer, poppier way than beforehand.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.treblezine.com/10-essential-post-britpop-tracks/ | title=10 Essential Post-Britpop tracks | date=22 March 2018 }}</ref> Post-Britpop experienced a greater level of success in the United States, with bands such as [[Keane (band)|Keane]], [[Travis (band)|Travis]], and (disputably) [[Radiohead]].

However, the most successful and popular band that came out of the post-Britpop scene was [[Coldplay]]. Coldplay pursued a pop rock style and had hits in both the United States<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/coldplay/ | title=Coldplay &#124; Biography, Music & News | magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] }}</ref> and the United Kingdom, and enjoy a lasting legacy to this day. Coldplay, much like pop rock of the past, managed to enjoy a multitude of mainstream hits. [[File:ColdplayBBC071221 (cropped).jpg | thumb|right | [[Coldplay]]]]

Other styles of rock were still prominent during the decade, but oftentimes had a less poppy style, such as [[post-grunge]] and [[emo]]. However, artists from past decades such as Bon Jovi and [[U2]] had continued success. As the next decade rolled in, the pop rock scene became less prominent and more commercial.

===2010s to present: Modern pop rock===
In the modern-day music scene, since 2010, pop rock has been marginalized to a greater extent.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://chroniclesmagazine.org/web/the-decline-and-fall-of-rock/ | title=The Decline and Fall of Rock - Chronicles | date=11 October 2024 }}</ref> Despite some bands having success, the genre is not as popular as before due to the onset of popularity for [[hip-hop]] and [[trap music]].

Pop rock artists often pursued a more pop-inspired sound in the 2010s, such as what happened in artists like [[Panic! at the Disco]], a former emo band that shifted to the mainstream,<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/panic-at-the-disco-2/ | title=Panic! At the Disco &#124; Biography, Music & News | magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] }}</ref> and [[Fun (band)|Fun.]], another pop rock band with major pop influences.

Amongst the most prominent artists of modern-day pop rock is [[Imagine Dragons]], who pursued a genre combining the genres of pop rock, alternative rock, and pop.<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/imagine-dragons/ | title=Imagine Dragons &#124; Biography, Music & News | magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] }}</ref> They had success with hit singles like "[[Radioactive (Imagine Dragons song)|Radioactive]]" and "[[Believer (Imagine Dragons song)|Believer]]", along with many other chart hits. [[File:Imagine Dragons, 2012.jpg | thumb|right | [[Imagine Dragons]]]]

Other artists from previous decades continued to have large chart success as well. These artists include [[Maroon 5]],<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/maroon-5/ | title=Maroon 5 &#124; Biography, Music & News | magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] }}</ref> a pop rock band influenced by [[blue-eyed soul]] that later shifted to pop, and the [[Arctic Monkeys]], who experienced large critical success with the album ''[[AM (Arctic Monkeys album)|AM]]''.

'''Contemporary R&B''' is a [[popular music]] [[Music genre|genre]], originating from [[African Americans|African-American]] musicians in the 1970s that combines [[rhythm and blues]] with elements of [[Pop music|pop]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[funk]], [[Hip-hop|hip hop]], and [[electronic music]]. The incorporation of pop and electronic textures and production styles, which came to prominence since the 2010s decade, brought forth a style called '''electro-R&B'''.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2016-12-06 |title=The 20 Best Pop and R&B Albums of 2016 |url=https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/9988-the-20-best-pop-and-rb-albums-of-2016/ |access-date=2025-07-05 |website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]}}</ref>

The genre features a distinctive [[Record producer|record production]] style and a smooth, lush style of vocal arrangement. [[Electronic music|Electronic]] influences and the use of hip hop or [[electronic dance music|dance]]-inspired [[beat (music)|beats]] are typical, although the roughness and grit inherent in hip hop may be reduced and smoothed out. Contemporary R&B vocalists often use [[melisma]], and since the mid-1980s, R&B rhythms have been combined with elements of hip hop culture and music, pop culture and pop music.

==Precursors==
According to [[Geoffrey Himes]] speaking in 1989, the [[progressive soul]] movement of the early 1970s "expanded the musical and lyrical boundaries of [R&B] in ways that haven't been equaled since". This movement was led by soul singers, songwriters and producers such as [[Curtis Mayfield]], [[Marvin Gaye]], and [[Stevie Wonder]].<ref>{{cite news|first= Geoffrey |last= Himes |title= Curtis Mayfield |newspaper= [[The Washington Post]] |date= August 29, 1989 |access-date= February 1, 2021 |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1989/08/29/curtis-mayfield/3256d94e-05a3-4c63-aaf9-58b7a563aab3/ |archive-date= March 29, 2021 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20210329042750/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1989/08/29/curtis-mayfield/3256d94e-05a3-4c63-aaf9-58b7a563aab3/ |url-status= live}}</ref> [[Norman Whitfield]]'s productions at [[Motown]], the record label of Gaye, were also pioneering for setting the soul vocals and simple [[hook (music)|hooks]] of earlier [[rhythm and blues]] records against strong [[backbeat]]s, vocal harmonies, and orchestral sounds, all of which thickened the [[texture (music)|texture]] of the music. Gaye's own music on albums such as ''[[What's Going On (Marvin Gaye album)|What's Going On]]'' (1971) incorporated [[jazz]] influences that led the genre into a looser musical direction.<ref name="circ"/>

The nearest precursor to contemporary R&B came at the end of the [[disco]] era in the late 1970s, when [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Quincy Jones]] added more electronic elements to the sound of the time, creating a smoother dancefloor-friendly style.<ref name="circ">{{cite web|first= David |last= Ward |title= R&B and Influence: The Producer as Ephebe |work= Circulation Mag |date= November 2011 |access-date= August 27, 2015 |url= http://www.circulation-mag.com/2011/11/rb-and-influence-the-producer-as-ephebe/ |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200728192100/http://www.circulation-mag.com/2011/11/rb-and-influence-the-producer-as-ephebe/ |archive-date= July 28, 2020}}</ref> The first result was ''[[Off the Wall]]'' (1979), which—according to [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] from [[AllMusic]]—"was a visionary album, that found a way to break disco wide open into a new world where the beat was undeniable, but not the primary focus" and "was part of a colorful tapestry of lush ballads and strings, smooth soul and pop, soft rock, and alluring funk".<ref>{{cite web|first= Stephen Thomas |last= Erlewine |author-link= Stephen Thomas Erlewine |title= Michael Jackson – Off the Wall |publisher= [[AllMusic]] |access-date= August 27, 2015 |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/off-the-wall-mw0000190332 |url-status= live |archive-date= December 20, 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151220235825/http://www.allmusic.com/album/off-the-wall-mw0000190332}}</ref>

Richard J. Ripani wrote that [[Janet Jackson]]'s ''[[Control (Janet Jackson album)|Control]]'' (1986) was "important to the development of R&B for several reasons", as she and her producers, [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]], "crafted a new sound that fuses the rhythmic elements of funk and disco, along with heavy doses of synthesizers, percussion, sound effects, and a rap music sensibility."<ref name="The New Blue Music">{{cite book|first= Richard J. |last= Ripani |year= 2006 |title= The New Blue Music: Changes in Rhythm & Blues, 1950–1999 |publisher= [[University Press of Mississippi]] |pages= 130–155, 186–188 |isbn= 978-1-57806-862-3}}</ref> Ripani wrote that "the success of "Control" led to the incorporation of stylistic traits of rap over the next few years, and Janet Jackson was to continue to be one of the leaders in that development."<ref name="The New Blue Music"/> That same year, [[Teddy Riley]] began producing R&B recordings that included hip hop influences. This combination of R&B style and hip hop rhythms was termed "[[new jack swing]]" and was applied to artists such as [[Keith Sweat]], [[Bobby Brown]], [[Johnny Kemp]], and [[Bell Biv DeVoe]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Jason|last=Heller|title= New jack swing|date=30 September 2010|website=[[The A.V.

Carey also released a remix of her 1995 single "[[Fantasy (Mariah Carey song)|Fantasy]]", with [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]] as a feature, a collaboration format that was unheard of at this point. Carey, Boyz II Men and [[TLC (group)|TLC]] released albums in 1994 and 1995—''[[Daydream (Mariah Carey album)|Daydream]]''.

In the late 1990s, [[neo soul]], which added 1970s soul influences to the hip-hop soul blend, arose, led by artists such as [[Erykah Badu]], [[Lauryn Hill]] and [[Maxwell (musician)|Maxwell]]. Hill and [[Missy Elliott]] further blurred the line between R&B and hip hop by recording both styles.

The award was later received by [[TLC (group)|TLC]] for ''[[CrazySexyCool]]'' in 1996, [[Tony Rich]] for ''Words'' in 1997, [[Erykah Badu]] for ''[[Baduizm]]'' in 1998 and [[Lauryn Hill]] for ''[[The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill]]'' in 1999. In 1994 the singer [[Aaliyah]] dropped her debut album and in 1996 she released her second album called "One In A Million" with different sounds and produced by Missy Elliot and [[Timbaland]], unknown at that moment.

It earned her three Grammy nominations winning one for the [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&B Album|Best Contemporary R&B Album]]. R&B newcomer [[Chris Brown]] released his self-titled album in 2005 which debuted at number two on the [[Billboard 200|"Billboard" 200]]. His debut single "[[Run It!]]" peaked atop on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] and the [[Hot 100 Airplay (Radio Songs)|US Radio Songs]].

Continuing from the 1990s and 2000s, R&B, like many other genres, drew influences from the technical innovations of the time and began to incorporate more electronic and machine-made sounds and instruments, this evolving style called '''electro-R&B''' slowly began dominating the genre. Historically, the electro-R&B sound had been associated with R&B songs with an electronic backbone by 1990s or 2000s girl groups like [[TLC (group)|TLC]] or [[Destiny's Child]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Smith |first=Da'Shan |date=May 30, 2018 |title=Master Class: A comprehensive history of the Electro-Hop&B genre in the 90s & 2000s |url=https://www.revolt.tv/article/2018-05-30/95641/master-class-a-comprehensive-history-of-the-electro-hopb-genre-in-the-90s-2000s |access-date=2025-07-05 |website=[[Revolt (TV network)|Revolt]]}}</ref> The use of effects such as [[Auto-Tune]] and new computerized synths have given R&B a more futuristic feel while still attempting to incorporate many of the genre's common themes such as love, relationships, heartbreak, and loss. As defined by [[Apple Music]], electro-R&B is "at the intersection of R&B and electronic music, creating abstract hip-hop that blends the moodier end of electro with minimal R&B beats".<ref>{{Cite web |title=The New Names of Electro R&B |url=https://music.apple.com/be/playlist/the-new-names-of-electro-r-b/pl.a8b90c055f9c48e8ad90bf0ace893114 |access-date=July 5, 2025 |publisher=[[Apple Music]]}}</ref> 

According to Christgau in 2017, "almost all R&B goes for voice-plus-sound rather than voice-plus-song, with the sound ranging from precision track-and-hook to idiosyncratic atmospherics."<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Robert |last= Christgau |title= On Syd's Depth and Resonance: Expert Witness with Robert Christgau |magazine= [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |date= March 3, 2017 |access-date= March 4, 2017 |url= https://www.vice.com/en/article/expert-witness-with-robert-christgau-turn-to-eros/ |url-status= live |archive-date= June 2, 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170602102143/https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/expert-witness-with-robert-christgau-turn-to-eros}}</ref>

==2020s==
In the 2020s, R&B continued to diversify and blend with other genres, most notably [[alternative R&B]], a subgenre characterized by its experimental production, introspective lyrics, and departure from traditional R&B structures. Artists such as [[SZA]], [[Victoria Monet]], [[Frank Ocean]], and [[the Weeknd]] have been pivotal in bridging mainstream R&B with alternative styles, introducing ethereal soundscapes, electronic elements, and unconventional storytelling to a broader audience.<ref>{{cite web|title= The Rise of Alternative R&B in Modern Music |website= TrillMag |date= March 29, 2023 |access-date= December 19, 2024 |url= https://www.trillmag.com/entertainment/music/the-rise-of-alternative-rb-in-modern-music/}}</ref>

Streaming platforms and social media, particularly [[TikTok]] and [[Spotify]], have amplified the reach of R&B music. Viral moments have catapulted songs like SZA's "[[Snooze (SZA song)|Snooze]]" and [[Daniel Caesar]]'s "[[Best Part (song)|Best Part]] (feat.

'''Walt Disney Records''' is an American [[record label]] owned by the [[Disney Music Group]]. The label releases [[soundtrack album]]s from [[the Walt Disney Company]]'s [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|motion picture studios]], television shows, [[Disney Experiences|theme parks]] and traditional [[studio albums]] produced by its roster of [[pop music|pop]], [[teen pop]] and [[country music|country]] artists.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hollis |first=Tim |title=Mouse tracks : the story of Walt Disney Records |date=2006 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |others=Greg Ehrbar |isbn=1-57806-848-7 |edition=1st |location=Jackson |oclc=61309354}}</ref>

The music label was founded in the Spring of 1956 as '''Disneyland Records'''. Before that time, Disney recordings were licensed to a variety of other labels such as [[RCA Records|RCA]], [[Decca Records|Decca]], [[Capitol Records|Capitol]], [[ABC Records|ABC-Paramount]], and [[United Artists Records|United Artists]]. It was Disney Legend Jimmy Johnson who convinced [[Walt Disney]]’s brother [[Roy O. Disney]] that Disney, at time known as ''Walt Disney Productions'' should form their own record label.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Johnson |first=Jimmy |title=Inside the whimsy works my life with Walt Disney Productions |date=2014 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |isbn=978-1-61703-930-0 |oclc=1228606843}}</ref> It adopted its current name in 1988 and is currently distributed worldwide by [[Universal Music Group]].

== History ==
Disneyland Records was predicated by non-soundtrack audio material based on [[Davy Crockett (miniseries)|Davy Crockett]] miniseries from the [[Walt Disney anthology television series|Disneyland anthology television series]], along with the song, "The Ballad of Davy Crockett," both featuring series star [[Fess Parker]]. These were licensed to [[Columbia Records]], but the smaller [[Cadence Records]] label released the more successful [[The Ballad of Davy Crockett|"Ballad of Davy Crockett"]] sung by [[Bill Hayes (actor)|Bill Hayes]] faster, and this was the record that topped the charts instead. The following year, Disney saw profits for Mickey Mouse Club records in the millions being shared with Golden Records and [[ABC Records]], finally convincing Roy to allow Johnson to start the in-house Disneyland Records.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Johnson |first=Jimmy |title=Inside the whimsy works : my life with Walt Disney Productions |date=2014 |editor1=Greg Ehrbar |editor2=Didier Ghez |isbn=978-1-61703-932-4 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |location=Jackson |oclc=855264296}}</ref>

=== Disneyland Records ===
[[File:Disneyland Records Logo.png|200px|right|thumb|Disneyland Records logo]]
The label was founded as Disneyland Records on February 4, 1956, with Jimmy Johnson as president, serving as the record unit of [[the Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Productions]]. Johnson brought in musician [[Tutti Camarata]] to head the [[Artists and repertoire|Artists and Repertoire]] department of this new enterprise. One ten-inch LP under the "Disneyland" imprint had been released a few months earlier, a musical version of ''A Child's Garden of Verses'', but it was distributed by the Charles Hansen music publishing company. The first album to be officially released directly by the label was ''Walt Disney Takes You to Disneyland'', the only album Walt had ever recorded especially for his own record label.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Walt's Very First Disney Records {{!}} |url=https://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/walts-very-first-disney-records/ |access-date=2022-08-17 |website=Cartoon Research}}</ref> Also in the first year, seven Disney animated movie soundtracks were issued by the label.<ref name="bbd">{{cite magazine |last1=Johnson |first1=Jimmy |date=March 27, 1971 |title=The Disneyland Records Story |page=D-2 |magazine=Billboard |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4AgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA34-IA2 |access-date=March 9, 2015}}</ref>

Disneyland Records issued Parker's "Wringle Wrangle" single from the ''[[Westward Ho the Wagons!]]'' film within a year of starting operations; the single became a hit. This led the company to start recording music from outside the films. However, what ever was released by the company the industry categorized as children. Pricing was directed towards an adult audience, which was more than standard children fare. The only outside success was Camarata’s album "Tutti's Trumpets". Thus in 1959, the Disneyland label became the soundtrack and children's label and Buena Vista label for the occasional pop song record.<ref name=bbd/>

Camarata established the label's initial forays into long-form musical albums, which included jazz interpretations of Disney standards from ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', ''[[Bambi]]'', and ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'', as well as original musical concept albums, and he expanded the format of soundtracks by including selections from the score as well as the songs.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Happy 105th Birthday, Disney Legend Tutti Camarata! {{!}} |url=https://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/happy-105th-birthday-disney-legend-tutti-camarata/ |access-date=2022-08-17 |website=Cartoon Research}}</ref> Tutti's connections within the music industry also brought to the label the likes of [[Mary Martin]], [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Louis Prima]] and [[Phil Harris]]. After popular Mouseketeer, [[Annette Funicello]], sang a song called "How Will I Know My Love" on the Mickey Mouse Club TV series, fans contacted the studio for the record, which became a minor hit. This prompted Camarata, Johnson and Walt Disney to encourage Annette's career as the label's first artist in residence. In 1959, the Buena Vista Records label was formed for Funicello's select recordings, soundtrack albums and other contemporary audiophile music.<ref name="Inc.1959">{{cite book|title=Billboard|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_KCAEAAAAMBAJ|access-date=July 26, 2013|date=March 16, 1959|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_KCAEAAAAMBAJ/page/n25 26]|issn=0006-2510}}</ref>

While looking for the right material for Annette, Tutti and his team discovered the songwriting duo of [[Richard M. Sherman]] and [[Robert B. Sherman]] after hearing one of their songs on the radio. The two were brought to the Disney studio in Burbank where they eventually became the first staff songwriters for the company.With the participation of the Sherman brothers and two technicians at Sunset Sound in Hollywood, Camarata developed his renowned "Annette Sound," a specific type of double/reverb recording to strengthen Annette's voice that became an industry standard. The Shermans penned not only a good deal of Annette's songs, but were also responsible for most of the iconic Disney songs of the 1960s and beyond – “[[It's a Small World]]” and “[[The Tiki Tiki Tiki Room]]” for the theme parks, as well as the songs from ''[[Mary Poppins (1964 film)|Mary Poppins]]'', ''[[Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree]]'', ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'', ''[[Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day]]'' and ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]''.

In 1960, Camarata left the staff but under Roy O. Disney's suggestion, established his own full-service recording studio where most of Disney and Buena Vista's records were recorded, mixed, engineered, cut and mastered, the Los Angeles landmark, [[Sunset Sound Recorders|Sunset Sound]]. In effect he was associated with Disney until the early seventies. Disneyland Records started its read-along series in 1965 with singer/actor [[Robie Lester]] appearing on more titles than any other in the history of the label.<ref>{{cite web |website=Cartoon Research |title=Saluting Disney's Record Setting Story Reader, Robie Lester |url=https://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/saluting-disneys-record-setting-story-reader-robie-lester/ |access-date=2022-08-17}}</ref>

By 1971, Disneyland Records was legally known as '''Disneyland/Vista Records'''. Additionally, ''[[A Child's Garden of Verses]]'' was still in their lineup.<ref name=bbd/> Disneyland/Vista worked with [[Rankin/Bass]] to release six recordings tied to [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|''The Hobbit'' 1977 animated film]].

The company was so successful with its ''Mickey Mouse Disco'' album that Disneyland looked to expand again into pop music by October 1980. Its success also lead to the issuance of animated theatrical shorts based on songs from the album. Two such original productions were "That Waddlin' Crazy Guy" and "Pardners" featuring the comedy singing team of Willio and Phillio (Will Ryan and Phil Baron).<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Sippel|first1=John|title=Disneyland Label going into Pop|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5CMEAAAAMBAJ&q=MICKEY+MOUSE+DISCO+news&pg=PT9|access-date=December 15, 2017|magazine=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|date=October 25, 1980|language=en}}</ref>

By 1985, while the label was now also known as '''Disneyland Records and Tapes''', its legal name was slightly changed to '''Disneyland/Vista Records and Tapes'''.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.discogs.com/label/369969-DisneylandVista-Records-Tapes |title=Disneyland/Vista Records & Tapes |website=[[Discogs]] |access-date=2023-06-19}}</ref>

Around 1987, the label began releasing their albums on [[CD]]. Some of the first albums that the label released on CD were The Disney Collection series.<ref>{{cite web |title=Various – The Disney Collection: Volume One |website=[[Discogs]] |url=https://www.discogs.com/release/5790507-Various-The-Disney-Collection-Volume-One |date=1987 |access-date=2023-06-19}}</ref>

=== Walt Disney Records ===
In 1988, Disneyland/Vista Records and Tapes was renamed '''Walt Disney Records''' (initially also known as '''Disney Records''' for three years).

Around 1990, Walt Disney Records signed several youth targeted acts like [[Parachute Express]] and [[Norman Foote]]. Disney let these acts go after several years as their mandate was changed to support the animated features, produce book and tape packages and compilations to take advantage of the catalog.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=McCormick |first1=Moira |title=Disney's 1st Teen Signing, Myra, Is Aimed At An Older audience |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rg8EAAAAMBAJ&q=Myra |access-date=October 23, 2018 |magazine=Billboard |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |date=June 24, 2000 |language=en}}</ref>

In May 2000, Walt Disney Records signed the label's first teen singer, [[Myra (singer)|Myra]]; her first single with the label, "Magic Carpet Ride", was released on May 23, 2000 as part of the ''La Vida Mickey'' album.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1432471/disney-signs-first-teen-pop-act-myra/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160718231023/http://www.mtv.com/news/1432471/disney-signs-first-teen-pop-act-myra/|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 18, 2016|title=Disney Signs First Teen Pop Act Myra|work=MTV News|date=May 19, 2000 |access-date=October 10, 2017|language=en}}</ref>

On June 24, 2014, Walt Disney Records launched a series entitled ''[[Walt Disney Records the Legacy Collection|The Legacy Collection]].'' The series includes original soundtracks, as well as unreleased music, and composer and producer liner notes. As of 2022, the collection includes 16 albums ranging between various anniversaries of various Disney films and Disneyland.<ref name=ut>{{cite news|last1=Grisham|first1=Lori|title=Walt Disney Records to release legacy collection|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/05/07/walt-disney-to-release-legacy-collection/8803881/|access-date=December 15, 2017|work=USA Today|date=May 7, 2014|language=en}}</ref>

With Disney's purchase of [[Lucasfilm]] on December 21, 2012, Walt Disney Records became the official record label for the studio and all ''[[Star Wars]]''-related soundtracks, beginning with [[Star Wars: The Force Awakens (soundtrack)|''The Force Awakens'' soundtrack]] on December 18, 2015. In January 2017, Disney acquired the distribution rights to the entire ''Star Wars'' [[Music of Star Wars|music catalog]] from [[Sony Classical]]; the soundtrack albums from the first six films were then released by Walt Disney Records in digital formats the same day.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dove Cameron, Sofia Carson, Jordan Fisher, Auli'i Cravalho, and Oscar®-Winning Composer Michael Giacchino to Meet Fans at the Disney Music Emporium During D23 Expo 2017, July 14–16|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170523006055/en/Dove-Cameron-Sofia-Carson-Jordan-Fisher-Auli%E2%80%99i|access-date=May 25, 2017|work=PR Newswire|date=May 23, 2017|location=Burbank, California|format=Press release}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/star-wars-a-new-hope-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-3-lp-vinyl-album-boxed-set-of-composer-john-williams-oscar-winning-score-to-be-released-on-december-1-300550649.html|title=Star Wars: A New Hope (original Motion Picture Soundtrack) 3-LP Vinyl Album Boxed Set Of Composer John Williams' Oscar®-Winning Score To Be Released On December 1|date=November 7, 2017|work=PR Newswire|access-date=November 7, 2017|format=Press release}}</ref> Disney [[reissue]]d the [[Remaster|digitally remastered]] original ''Star Wars'' soundtrack albums in physical formats on May 4, 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/disney-music-group-set-to-release-first-6-remastered-star-wars-original-motion-picture-soundtracks-on-may-4-300617275.html|title=Disney Music Group Set To Release First 6 Remastered Star Wars Original Motion Picture Soundtracks On May 4|date=March 21, 2018|access-date=March 21, 2018|publisher=Walt Disney Records|agency=PR Newswire|location=Burbank, California}}</ref>

In 2024, Disney acquired the distribution rights to the first four ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' soundtrack albums from [[Concord Records]]; the soundtracks were then reissued by Walt Disney Records later that year. That same year, Walt Disney Records released ''[[A Whole New Sound]]'', an album of pop-punk cover versions of classic songs from Disney films. The first single from the album, a cover of [[Elton John]]'s "[[Can You Feel the Love Tonight]]" by [[Simple Plan]], was released on July 12, 2024.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kaufman |first1=Gil |title=Simple Plan's Take on Elton John's 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight' to Lead 'A Whole New Sound' Disney Album |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/simple-plan-cover-elton-john-can-you-feel-the-love-tonight-disney-whole-new-sound-album-1235728977/ |access-date=16 July 2024 |publisher=Billboard |date=11 July 2024}}</ref> 

On May 13, 2025, for the 70th anniversary of [[Disneyland]], Walt Disney Records released the seven-song compilation album ''Music From Disneyland Resort 70th Celebration''.

'''Columbia Records''' is an American [[record label]] owned by [[Sony Music Entertainment]], a subsidiary of [[Sony Music Group]], an American subsidiary of multinational conglomerate [[Sony]]. Founded on January 15, 1889, Columbia is the oldest surviving brand name in the recorded sound business,<ref>{{cite book|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2CMEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA35|date=September 17, 1955|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=35|issn=0006-2510}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/31/books/360-sound-celebrates-columbia-records-125th-anniversary.html|title=From One Mine, the Gold of Pop History|author=Ben Sisario|date=October 30, 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=February 28, 2013|archive-date=January 26, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210126100823/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/31/books/360-sound-celebrates-columbia-records-125th-anniversary.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbiarecords.com/timeline/#!date=1885-08-06_18:54:22!|title=125 Years of Columbia Records – An Interactive Timeline|access-date=November 8, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114143057/http://www.columbiarecords.com/timeline/#!date=1885-08-06_18:54:22!|archive-date=November 14, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> and the second major company to produce records.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.memory.loc.gov/ammem/berlhtml/berlgramo.html |title=Emile Berliner and the Birth of the Recording Industry: The Gramophone |access-date=November 8, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020820104538/http://www.memory.loc.gov/ammem/berlhtml/berlgramo.html |archive-date=August 20, 2002}}</ref> It is one of Sony Music's four flagship record labels, along with [[Epic Records]], former longtime rival [[RCA Records]], and [[Arista Records]].

[[File:Columbia1116D.jpg|thumb|The American label of an electrically recorded Columbia disc by [[Art Gillham]] from the mid-1920s]]
The Columbia Phonograph Company was founded on January 15, 1889, by stenographer, lawyer, and [[New Jersey]] native [[Edward D. Easton]] (1856–1915) and a group of investors. It derived its name from the [[District of Columbia]], where it was headquartered.<ref name="IEEE Easton">{{cite web|title=Edward Easton|url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Edward_Easton|publisher=IEEE|access-date=January 22, 2014|archive-date=February 2, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202110636/http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Edward_Easton|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Bilton|first=Lynn|title=Hail, Columbia: A fresh book at last gives Edward Easton and his Graphophone company their due|url=http://www.intertique.com/Hail%20Columbia.htm|access-date=January 22, 2014|year=1998|archive-date=May 16, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140516015848/http://www.intertique.com/Hail%20Columbia.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> At first, it had a local monopoly on sales and service of Edison [[phonograph]]s and [[phonograph cylinder]]s in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Maryland]], and [[Delaware]]. As was the custom of some of the regional phonograph companies, Columbia produced many commercial cylinder recordings of its own, and its catalog of musical records in 1891 was 10 pages.

Columbia's ties to Edison were severed in 1894 with the [[North American Phonograph Company]]'s breakup. Thereafter, it sold only records and phonographs of its own manufacture. In 1902, Columbia introduced the "XP" record, a molded brown wax record, to use up old stock. Columbia introduced black wax records in 1903. According to one source, they continued to mold brown waxes until 1904. The molded brown waxes may have been sold to [[Sears]] for distribution (possibly under Sears' Oxford trademark for Columbia products).<ref>{{cite web |last=Gracyk |first=Tim |url=http://www.gracyk.com/wax.shtml |title=Tim Gracyk's Phonographs, Singers, and Old Records – How Late Did Columbia Use Brown Wax? |publisher=Gracyk.com |date=October 11, 1904 |access-date=December 31, 2009 |archive-date=October 1, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001173001/http://www.gracyk.com/wax.shtml |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Columbia began selling [[disc records]], invented and patented by Victor Talking Machine Company's [[Emile Berliner]], and phonographs in addition to the cylinder system in 1901, preceded only by their "Toy Graphophone" of 1899, which used small, vertically cut records. For a decade, Columbia competed with both the [[Edison Phonograph Company]] cylinders and [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] disc records as one of the top three names in American sound recording.

In 1903, to add prestige to its early catalog of artists, Columbia contracted several prominent singers from the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York to make a highly touted series of Grand Opera Records. These stars included [[Marcella Sembrich]], [[Lillian Nordica]], [[Antonio Scotti]], and [[Edouard de Reszke]], but the technical standard of Columbia's Grand Opera series was not considered to be as high as the results achieved with opera singers during the pre–World War I period by Victor, Edison, England's [[His Master's Voice (British record label)|His Master's Voice]] (The [[Gramophone Company]] Ltd.) or Italy's [[Fonotipia Records]]. After an abortive attempt in 1904 to manufacture discs with the recording grooves stamped into both sides of each disc—not just one—in 1908 Columbia commenced successful mass production of what they called their "Double-Faced" discs, the 10-inch variety initially selling for 65 cents each. Columbia also introduced the internal-horn "[[Grafonola]]" to compete with the extremely popular "[[Victrola]]" introduced by the rival Victor Talking Machine Company in 1906.

During this era, Columbia began to use the "Magic Notes" logo—a pair of sixteenth notes (semiquavers) in a circle—both in the United States and overseas (where this particular logo would never substantially change).

In 1908, Columbia ceased the recording and manufacturing of wax cylinder records after arranging to issue celluloid cylinder records made by the [[Indestructible Record Company]] of [[Albany, New York]], as "Columbia Indestructible Records". In July 1912, Columbia decided to concentrate exclusively on disc records and ended production of cylinder phonographs, although Indestructible cylinders continued to be sold under the Columbia label for a few more years.
<!-- Started on a proper update of the various names in the company's history, but realised it would take rather longer than I thought. Left here to finish later, MinorProphet, 5 December 2022

In January 1913, the Columbia Phonograph Company was renamed the '''Columbia Graphophone Company''', in recognition of its main product, the [[Graphophone]]. Edward Easton remained as President.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Brook |editor-first=Tim |editor2-last=Rust |editor2-first=Brian |title=Columbia Master Book, Volume I |chapter=Columbia Corporate History: Columbia Demonstration Records |publisher=Greenwood Press |date=1999 |series=(online edition) |url=https://adp.library.ucsb.edu/index.php/resources/detail/110}}</ref>

Columbia was split into two companies, one to make records and one to make players. Columbia Phonograph relocated to [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], and Edward Easton went with it. Eventually it was renamed the [[Dictaphone Corporation]].<ref name="IEEE Easton"/>

=== Columbia Phonograph Company ownership (1925–1931) ===
[[File:Columbia recording by Paul Whiteman.jpg|right|thumb|The British label of an electrically recorded Columbia disc by [[Paul Whiteman]]]]
In late 1922, Columbia entered receivership.<ref name="New Grove">{{cite book|last1=Rye|first1=Howard |last2=Kernfeld |first2=Barry|editor1-last=Kernfeld|editor1-first=Barry|title=The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz|date=2002|publisher=Grove's Dictionaries Inc.|location=New York|isbn=1-56159-284-6|page=172|volume=1|edition=2nd}}</ref>

The company was bought by its UK subsidiary, the [[Columbia Graphophone Company]], in 1925 and the label, record numbering system, and recording process changed. On February 25, 1925, Columbia began recording with the electric recording process licensed from [[Western Electric]].<ref name=Brooks_Late_20s >{{citation |title=Columbia Corporate History: Electrical Recording and the Late 1920s |series=Columbia Master Book Discography, Volume I |editor-last=Brooks |editor-first=Tim |edition=Online |publisher=Discography of American Historical Recordings (DAHR) |url=https://adp.library.ucsb.edu/index.php/resources/detail/114 |access-date=June 26, 2022 |archive-date=June 25, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220625221200/https://adp.library.ucsb.edu/index.php/resources/detail/114 |url-status=live }}</ref> "Viva-tonal" records set a benchmark in tone and clarity unequaled on commercial discs during the 78-rpm era. The first electrical recordings were made by [[Art Gillham]], the "Whispering Pianist". In a secret agreement with Victor, electrical technology was kept secret to avoid hurting sales of acoustic records.

Louis Sterling, managing director of the Columbia Graphophone Company, had been the moving force behind bringing Western Electric's recording process, and the British takeover. Originally from New York, Sterling became Chairman of Columbia NY from 1925 until 1931, and oversaw stability and success.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}

In 1926, Columbia acquired [[Okeh Records]] and its growing stable of jazz and blues artists, including [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Clarence Williams (musician)|Clarence Williams]]. Columbia had already built a catalog of blues and jazz artists, including [[Bessie Smith]] in their 14000-D Race series. Columbia also had a successful "Hillbilly" series (15000-D) with [[Dan Hornsby]] among others. By 1927, the "Sweet Jazz" bandleader [[Guy Lombardo]] also joined Columbia and recorded forty five 78 rpm's by 1931.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/guy-lombardo-and-his-royal-canadians-emc |title=The Canadian Encyclopedia: "Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians" Mookg, Edward B.

During the same year, Columbia executive [[Frank Buckley Walker]] pioneered some of the first country music or "hillbilly" genre recordings with the [[Johnson City sessions]] in Tennessee, including artists such as [[Clarence Horton Greene]] and [[Charlie Bowman|"Fiddlin'" Charlie Bowman]]. He followed that with a return to Tennessee the next year, and recording sessions in other cities of the South. The [[Two Black Crows]] 1926 recording "The Early Bird Catches the Worm" sold 2.5 million copies.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Murrells |first=Joseph |url=http://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr |title=The book of golden discs |date=1978 |publisher=London : Barrie & Jenkins |others=Internet Archive |isbn=978-0-214-20512-5}}</ref>

In 1929, [[Ben Selvin]] became house bandleader and A. & R. director. Other favorites in the Viva-tonal era included [[Ruth Etting]], Paul Whiteman, [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[Ipana Troubadours]] (a Sam Lanin group), and [[Ted Lewis (musician)|Ted Lewis]]. Columbia used acoustic recording for "budget label" pop product well into 1929 on the labels Harmony, Velvet Tone (both general purpose labels), and [[Diva Records|Diva]] (sold exclusively at [[W.T. Grant]] stores). When Edison Records folded, Columbia was the oldest surviving record label.

=== Columbia ownership separation (1931–1936) ===

The repercussions of the stock market [[crash of 1929]] and subsequent [[Great Depression]] led to the near collapse of the entire recording industry and, in March 1931, J.P Morgan, the major shareholder, steered the Columbia Graphophone Company (along with [[Odeon records]] and [[Parlophone]], which it had owned since 1926) into a merger with the [[Gramophone Company]] ("His Master's Voice") to form Electric and Musical Industries Ltd ([[EMI]]).<ref name=Brooks_Early_30s >{{citation |title=Columbia Corporate History: Market Crash, 1929, and the Early 1930s |series=Columbia Master Book Discography, Volume I |editor-last=Brooks |editor-first=Tim |edition=Online |publisher=Discography of American Historical Recordings (DAHR) |url=https://adp.library.ucsb.edu/index.php/resources/detail/115 }} ''See also'' [https://adp.library.ucsb.edu/index.php/resources/detail/131 Notes section] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230531191830/https://adp.library.ucsb.edu/index.php/resources/detail/131 |date=May 31, 2023 }}.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Sir Louis Sterling and his library |last=Walworth |first=Julia |journal=Jewish Historical Studies |volume=40 |year=2005 |page=161 |publisher=Jewish Historical Society of England |jstor=24027031}}</ref><ref name="news.bbc.co.uk">{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/616485.stm |title=EMI: A Brief History |work=BBC News |access-date=15 January 2009 |date=24 January 2000 |archive-date=August 16, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240816113930/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/616485.stm |url-status=live }}</ref> Since the Gramophone Company (HMV) was now a wholly owned subsidiary of Victor, and Columbia in America was a subsidiary of UK Columbia, Victor now technically owned its largest rival in the US.<ref name=Brooks_Early_30s /> To avoid [[antitrust]] legislation, EMI had to sell off its US Columbia operation, which continued to release pressings of matrices made in the UK.<ref name=Brooks_Early_30s />

In December, 1931, the U.S. Columbia Phonograph Company, Inc. was acquired by the [[Majestic Radios#Grigsby-Grunow years (1927-1934)|Grigsby-Grunow Company]], the manufacturers of Majestic radios and refrigerators.

On December 3, 1931, CFI made a deal with [[Warner Brothers Pictures|Warner Brothers Pictures, Inc.]] ("WB") to lease [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick Record Corporation]], which included the trademarks and masters of the Brunswick, [[Vocalion]], and [[Melotone Records (US)|Melotone]] labels to ARC. WB would receive a portion of the sales of its catalogues, while ARC was free to use the labels for new recordings. Brunswick immediately became the premium $.75 label, Melotone would release new hillbilly and other $.35 dime-store discounted discs, and Vocalion, while re-releasing prior ARC records, would also be the blues-R&B label, and the exclusive outlet for [[Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys]], a mid-1930s [[Western Swing]] band which drew 10,000+ customers nightly to dance. Columbia was added in mid-1932, relegated to slower sellers such as the Hawaiian music of [[Andy Iona]], the [[Irving Mills]] stable of artists and songs, and the still unknown [[Benny Goodman]]. It tried a marketing ploy, the Columbia "Royal Blue Record", a blue laminated product with matching label. Royal Blue issues, made from late 1932 through 1935, are particularly popular with collectors for their rarity and musical interest. The Columbia plant in Oakland, California, did Columbia's pressings for sale west of the Rockies and continued using the Royal Blue material for these until about mid-1936.

As [[southern gospel]] developed, Columbia had astutely sought to record the artists associated with the emerging genre; for example, Columbia was the only company to record [[Charles Davis Tillman]]. Most fortuitously for Columbia in its Depression Era financial woes, in 1936 the company entered into an exclusive recording contract with the [[Chuck Wagon Gang]], a hugely successful relationship which continued into the 1970s. A signature group of southern gospel, the Chuck Wagon Gang became Columbia's bestsellers with at least 37&nbsp;million records,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rcenter.org/Home/News/Concerts/ChuckWagonGang.asp |title=Solid Gospel series brings Chuck Wagon Gang to Renaissance Center. |access-date=November 8, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120810135439/http://www.rcenter.org/Home/News/Concerts/ChuckWagonGang.asp |archive-date=August 10, 2012}}</ref> many of them through the aegis of the ''Mull Singing Convention of the Air'' sponsored on radio (and later television) by southern gospel broadcaster [[J. Bazzel Mull]] (1914–2006).

In 1935, Herbert M. Greenspon, an 18-year-old shipping clerk, led a committee to organize the first trade union shop at the main manufacturing factory in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Elected as president of the Congress of Industrial Unions (CIO) local, Greenspon negotiated the first contract between factory workers and Columbia management. In a career with Columbia that lasted 30 years, Greenspon retired after achieving the position of executive vice president of the company. Columbia also hired talent scout, music writer, producer, and impresario [[John Henry Hammond|John Hammond]] in 1937. Alongside his significance as a discoverer, promoter, and producer of jazz, blues, and folk artists during the [[swing music]] era, Hammond had already been of great help to Columbia in 1932–33. Through his involvement in the UK music paper ''[[Melody Maker]]'', Hammond had arranged for the struggling US Columbia label to provide recordings for the UK Columbia label, mostly using the specially created Columbia W-265000 matrix series. Hammond recorded [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[Benny Carter]], [[Joe Venuti]], [[Roger Wolfe Kahn]] and other jazz performers during a time when the economy was bad enough that many of them would not have had the opportunity to enter a studio and play real jazz (a handful of these in this special series were issued in the US). Hammond's work for Columbia was interrupted by his service during [[World War II]], and he had less involvement with the music scene during the [[bebop]] era, but when he returned to work as a talent scout for Columbia in the 1950s, his career proved to be of incalculable historical and cultural importance – the list of superstar artists he would discover and sign to Columbia over the course of his career included [[Charlie Christian]], [[Count Basie]], [[Teddy Wilson]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], and in the early 1960s Hammond would also exert an enormous cultural effect on the emerging rock music scene thanks to his championing of reissue LPs of the music of blues artists [[Robert Johnson]] and [[Bessie Smith]].

By 1937–38, the record business in America was finally recovering from the near-death blow of the Great Depression, at least for RCA Victor and Decca, but privately, there were doubts about the survival of ARC.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wilentz |first=Sean |title=360 Sound the Columbia Records Story |publisher=Chronicle Books |year=2012 |isbn=9781452107561 |location=New York |pages=90–95}}</ref> In a 1941 court case brought by unhappy shareholders of [[Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.]] ("CBS"), Edward Wallerstein, a high executive with RCA Victor from 1932 thru 1938, was asked to comment on ARC. "The chief value was that the record industry had come back tremendously, especially in the case of two other record companies; and the American Record Company, with all its facilities, had not, so far as I could learn, increased its business in any degree at all in the previous six years."<ref name=NYSC/>

(Columbia Records had originally co-founded CBS in 1927 along with New York talent agent [[Arthur Judson]], but soon cashed out of the partnership leaving only the name; Paley acquired the fledgling radio network in 1928.) On January 3, 1939, Wallerstein left RCA Victor to become president of the CBS phonograph subsidiary, a position he would hold for twelve years. CBS kept the ARC name for three months. then on April 4, it amended the New York Department of State record of "Columbia Phonograph Company, Inc.," naming several of its own employees to directorships, and announced in a press release, "The American Record Co. tag is discarded". Columbia Records was actually reborn on May 22, 1939, as "Columbia Recording Corporation, Inc.", a Delaware corporation.<ref name=StoryColumbia/> The NYDOS shows a later incorporation date of April 4, 1947.

In February 1939, NYC Studios moved from ARC headquarters at 1776 Broadway, to [[A & R Recording#Second studio, Studios A-1 and A-2 – 799 7th Avenue|799 7th Avenue, 6th&7th flrs, New York City]] ("Studio A"). Corporate offices, studio and Pressing Plant would also continue at 1473 Barnum Avenue, Bridgeport, Connecticut. John Hammond was hired by Wallerstein as "Associate Director Popular Recording" (at 7th Ave). Another executive from ARC, [[Art Satherley]], was not expected to transition over as easily. "It is understood that CBS and the Levys are not interested in retaining American Record's hillbilly department, and that Art Satherly, who has been running this section for many years, will take it out of the company with him". Fortunately, to the delight of many, this did not happen, and Art went on to many more successful years supervising all aspects of Columbia's [[Country music|Hillbilly/Country]] artists and sessions.

On August 30, 1939, Columbia replaced its $.75 Brunswick record for a $.50 Columbia label.<ref>{{Cite news |date=August 30, 1939 |title=Columbia drops its Brunswick label |pages=241 |work=Variety |url=https://archive.org/details/variety135-1939-08/page/n241/mode/2up?q=Brunswick |access-date=June 18, 2022}}</ref> Brunswick was gradually phased out, the final issue  being Brunswick 8520, in April 1940. Wallerstein and Paley knew in advance that their course of action would lead to violation of the 1931 Brunswick lease agreement, so they discontinued Vocalion in June 1940, and fired up Okeh. By July, it was releasing new Hillbilly platters by [[Gene Autry]] and Bob Wills, and re-issuing past Vocalion discs, using the same catalogue numbers with a leading zero added.  When a January 1941 audit found that not more than 150,000 Brunswick records had sold during the period from December 1, 1939, through December 31, 1940, control of the loaned trademarks and catalog of master recordings made prior to December 3, 1931, reverted to Warner Bros. Pictures.

The Columbia trademark from this point until the late 1950s was two overlapping circles with the Magic Notes in the left circle and a CBS microphone in the right circle. The Royal Blue labels were dropped in favor of a deep red, which caused [[RCA Victor]] to claim infringement on its famous [[RCA Red Seal Records|Red Seal]] trademark (RCA lost the case). The blue Columbia label was retained for its classical music [[Columbia Masterworks Records]] series until it was later changed to a green label before switching to a gray label in the late 1950s, and then to the bronze that is familiar to owners of Columbia/CBS classical and Broadway albums. Columbia Phonograph Company of Canada did not survive the [[Great Depression]], so CBS made a distribution deal with [[Sparton Records]] in 1939 to release Columbia records in Canada under the Columbia name.

During the 1940s, [[Frank Sinatra]] recorded for Columbia and helped to substantially boost the company's revenue. Sinatra recorded over 200 songs for Columbia which include his most popular songs from his early years. Other popular artists on Columbia at this time included [[Benny Goodman]] (signed from RCA Victor in 1939), [[Count Basie]], [[Jimmie Lunceford]] (both signed from Decca), [[Eddy Duchin]], [[Ray Noble]] (both moved to Columbia from Brunswick), [[Kate Smith]], [[Mildred Bailey]], and [[Will Bradley]].

In 1947, the company was renamed Columbia Records Inc.<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://www.loc.gov/item/2002655160/| title=Columbia Records paperwork collection| website=[[Library of Congress]]| access-date=July 21, 2018| archive-date=March 8, 2021| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308121749/https://www.loc.gov/item/2002655160/| url-status=live}}</ref> and founded its Mexican record company, Discos Columbia de Mexico.<ref>{{cite book|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQsEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA60|access-date=July 21, 2013|date=March 16, 1963|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=60|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> 1948 saw the first classical LP [[Mendelssohn Violin Concerto (Nathan Milstein album)|Nathan Milstein's recording of the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto]].

=== The LP record (1948–1959) ===
Columbia's president Edward Wallerstein was instrumental in steering Paley towards the ARC purchase. He set his talents to his goal of hearing an entire movement of a symphony on one side of an album. Ward Botsford writing for the Twenty-Fifth Anniversary Issue of ''High Fidelity Magazine'' relates: "He was no inventor—he was simply a man who seized an idea whose time was ripe and begged, ordered, and cajoled a thousand men into bringing into being the now accepted medium of the record business." Despite Wallerstein's stormy tenure, in June 1948, Columbia introduced the Long Playing "microgroove" [[LP record]] format (sometimes written "Lp" in early advertisements), which rotated at 33⅓ [[revolutions per minute]], to be the standard for the gramophone record for forty years. CBS research director Dr. [[Peter Carl Goldmark|Peter Goldmark]] played a managerial role in the collaborative effort, but Wallerstein credits engineer [[William Savory]] with the technical prowess that brought the long-playing disc to the public.<ref name="catalog1949">{{cite book|title=Columbia Record Catalog 1949|publisher=Columbia Records Inc.|pages=1–20}}</ref>

By the early 1940s, Columbia had been experimenting with higher fidelity recordings, and longer masters, which paved the way for the successful release of the LPs in 1948. One such record that helped set a new standard for music listeners was the 10" LP reissue of ''[[The Voice of Frank Sinatra]]'', originally released on March 4, 1946, as an album of four 78 rpm records, which was the first pop album issued in the new LP format. [[Sinatra]] was arguably Columbia's hottest commodity and his artistic vision combined with the direction Columbia were taking the medium of music, both popular and classic, were well suited. ''The Voice of Frank Sinatra'' was also considered to be the first genuine ''[[concept album]]''. Since the term "LP" has come to refer to the 12-inch {{frac|33|1|3}} rpm vinyl disk, the first LP is the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto in E minor played by Nathan Milstein with Bruno Walter conducting the New York Philharmonic (then called the Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra of New York), Columbia ML 4001, found in the Columbia Record Catalog for 1949, published in July 1948. The other "LP's" listed in the catalog were in the 10 inch format starting with ML 2001 for the light classics, CL 6001 for popular songs and JL 8001 for children's records.<ref name="catalog1949"/> The [[Library of Congress]] in Washington DC now holds the Columbia Records Paperwork Archive which shows the Label order for ML 4001 being written on March 1, 1948. One can infer that Columbia was pressing the first LPs for distribution to their dealers for at least 3 months prior to the introduction of the LP on June 21,<ref name="LoC">[https://blogs.loc.gov/now-see-hear/2019/04/inside-the-archival-box-the-first-long-playing-disc/ ''The First Long-Playing Disc''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210624202300/https://blogs.loc.gov/now-see-hear/2019/04/inside-the-archival-box-the-first-long-playing-disc/ |date=June 24, 2021 }} Library of Congress (Congress.gov) (accessdate 21 June 2021)</ref> 1948.<ref>Library of Congress Columbia Records Paperwork Box 121</ref> The catalog numbering system has had minor changes ever since.

Columbia's LPs were particularly well-suited to classical music's longer pieces, so some of the early albums featured such artists as [[Eugene Ormandy]] and the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], [[Bruno Walter]] and the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]], and [[Sir Thomas Beecham]] and the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]]. The success of these recordings persuaded [[Capitol Records]] to begin releasing LPs in 1949. Even before the LP record was officially demonstrated, Columbia offered to share the new speed with rival RCA Victor, who initially rejected it and soon introduced their new competitive 45 RPM record. When it became clear that the LP was the preferred format for classical recordings, RCA Victor announced that the company would begin releasing its own LPs in January 1950. This was quickly followed by the other major American labels. [[Decca Records]] in the U.K. was the first to release LPs in Europe, beginning in 1949. EMI would not fully adopt the LP format until 1955.

An "original cast recording" of [[Rodgers & Hammerstein]]'s ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'' with [[Ezio Pinza]] and [[Mary Martin]] was recorded in 1949. Both conventional metal masters and tape were used in the sessions in New York City. For some reason, the taped version was not used until Sony released it as part of a set of CDs devoted to Columbia's Broadway albums.<ref>Sony liner notes</ref>  Over the years, Columbia joined Decca and RCA Victor in specializing in albums devoted to Broadway musicals with members of the original casts. In the 1950s, Columbia also began releasing LPs drawn from the soundtracks of popular films.

Many album covers put together by Columbia and the other major labels were put together using one piece of cardboard (folded in half) and two paper "slicks", one for the front and one for the back. The front slick bent around the top, bottom, and left sides (the right side is open for the record to be inserted into the cover) and glued the two halves of cardboard together at the top and bottom. The back slick is pasted over the edges of the pasted-on front slick to make it appear that the album cover is one continuous piece.

Columbia discovered that printing two front cover slicks, one for mono and one for stereo, was inefficient and therefore needlessly costly. Starting in the summer of 1959 with some of the albums released in August, they went to the "paste-over" front slick, which had the stereo information printed on the top and the mono information printed on the bottom. For stereo issues, they moved the front slick down so the stereo information was showing at the top, and the mono information was bent around the bottom to the back and "pasted over" by the back slick. Conversely, for a mono album, they moved the slick up so the mono information showed at the bottom, and the stereo information was pasted over. Soon, other record companies had adopted the paste-over method.

Columbia became the most successful non-rock record company in the 1950s, after it lured producer and bandleader [[Mitch Miller]] away from the Mercury label in 1950. Despite its many successes, Columbia remained largely uninvolved in the teenage rock'n'roll market until the mid-1960s, despite a handful of crossover hits, largely because of Miller's frequently expressed loathing of rock'n'roll. (Miller was a classically trained oboist who had been a friend of Columbia executive Goddard Lieberson since their days at the [[Eastman School of Music]] in the 1930s.){{sfnp|Dannen|1991|p=62}} Miller quickly signed up Mercury's biggest artist at the time, [[Frankie Laine]], and discovered several of the decade's biggest recording stars including [[Tony Bennett]], [[Mahalia Jackson]], [[Jimmy Boyd]], [[Guy Mitchell]] (whose stage surname was taken from Miller's first name), [[Johnnie Ray]], [[the Four Lads]], [[Rosemary Clooney]], [[Kay Lande]], [[Ray Conniff]], [[Jerry Vale]] and [[Johnny Mathis]]. He also oversaw many of the early singles by the label's top female recording star of the decade, [[Doris Day]].

In 1953, Columbia formed a new subsidiary label [[Epic Records]].<ref name="Inc.1953">{{cite book|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZAoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA16|access-date=July 21, 2013|date=September 19, 1953|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=16|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> 1954 saw Columbia end its distribution arrangement with Sparton Records and form Columbia Records of Canada.<ref name=ce>{{Cite web |url=https://thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/sony-music-entertainment-inc-emc|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203002802/http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=U1ARTU0003271|url-status=dead |title=Sony Music Entertainment Inc &#124; The Canadian Encyclopedia|archivedate=February 3, 2010|website=thecanadianencyclopedia.ca}}</ref> To enhance its country music stable, which already included [[Marty Robbins]], [[Ray Price]] and [[Carl Smith (musician)|Carl Smith]], Columbia bid $15,000 for [[Elvis Presley]]'s contract from [[Sun Records]] in 1955.<ref name="Elvis">{{cite book|last=Worth|first=Fred|title=Elvis: His Life from A to Z|year=1992|publisher=Outlet|isbn=978-0-517-06634-8|page=38}}</ref> Presley's manager, [[Colonel Tom Parker]], turned down their offer and signed Presley with RCA Victor.<ref name="Elvis"/> However, Columbia did sign two Sun artists in 1958: [[Johnny Cash]] and [[Carl Perkins]].<ref name="Elvis"/>

With 1954, Columbia U.S. decisively broke with its past when it introduced its new, [[modernist]]-style "Walking Eye" logo,<ref>{{cite book|date=September 11, 1954|title=Billboard |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_xiEEAAAAMBAJ_2|access-date=July 21, 2013|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_xiEEAAAAMBAJ_2/page/n44 45]|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> designed by Columbia's art director [[S. Neil Fujita]]. This logo actually depicts a stylus (the legs) on a record (the eye); however, the "eye" also subtly refers to CBS's main business in [[CBS Network|television]], and that division's iconic Eye logo. Columbia continued to use the "notes and mike" logo on record labels and even used a promo label showing both logos until the "notes and mike" was phased out (along with the 78 in the US) in 1958. In Canada, Columbia 78s were pressed with the "Walking Eye" logo in 1958. The original Walking Eye was tall and solid; it was modified in 1961<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GSEEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22columbia+representative%22+%2B+billboard+%2B+1961&pg=PA16|title=columbia representative |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]  |date=August 14, 1961}}</ref> to the familiar one still used today (pictured on this page), despite the fact that the Walking Eye was used only sporadically during most of the 1990s.

Although the big band era had passed, Columbia had [[Duke Ellington]] under contract for several years, capturing the historic moment when Ellington's band provoked a post-midnight frenzy (followed by international headlines) at the 1956 [[Newport Jazz Festival]], which proved a boost to a bandleader whose career had stalled. Under new head producer [[George Avakian]], Columbia became the most vital label to the general public's appreciation and understanding (with help from Avakian's prolific and perceptive play-by-play liner notes) of jazz, releasing a series of LPs by [[Louis Armstrong]], but also signing to long-term contracts [[Dave Brubeck]] and [[Miles Davis]], the two modern jazz artists who would in 1959 record albums that remain—more than sixty years later—among the best-selling jazz albums by any label—viz., ''[[Time Out (album)|Time Out]]'' by the Brubeck Quartet and, to an even greater extent, ''[[Kind of Blue]]'' by the Davis Sextet, which, in 2003, appeared as number 12 in ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s list of the "[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums Of All Time]]".<ref>{{cite magazine| title=Kind of Blue| magazine=Rollingstone.com| date=February 9, 2003| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-19691231/kind-of-blue-miles-davis-19691231| access-date=April 11, 2012| url-status=dead| archive-date=March 17, 2011| archive-url=https://archive.today/20110317190607/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-19691231/kind-of-blue-miles-davis-19691231}}</ref> With another producer, [[Teo Macero]], a skilled modernist composer himself, Columbia cemented contracts with jazz composer/musicians [[Thelonious Monk]] and [[Charles Mingus]], while Macero became a significant figure in Miles Davis career from an explorer of the art of [[modal jazz]] from Davis' sextets 1958 album ''[[Milestones (Miles Davis album)|Milestones]]'' to innovator and avatar of the marriage of jazz with rock and electronic sounds—commonly known as [[jazz fusion]].

In 1954, Columbia embraced small-group modern jazz by signing of the Dave Brubeck Quartet, which resulted in the release of the on-location, best-selling jazz album (up to this time), ''[[Jazz Goes to College]]''. Contemporaneously with Columbia's first release of modern jazz by a small group, which was also the Brubeck Quartet's debut on the label, was a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine cover story on the phenomenon of Brubeck's success on college campuses. The humble [[Dave Brubeck]] demurred, saying that the second ''Time'' cover story on a jazz musician (the first featured [[Louis Armstrong]]'s picture) had been earned by [[Duke Ellington]], not himself. Within two years Ellington's picture would appear on the cover of ''Time'', following his success at the 1956 Newport Jazz Festival. [[Ellington at Newport]], recorded on Columbia, was also the bandleader-composer-pianist's best-selling album. Moreover, this exclusive trinity of jazz giants featured on the cover of ''Time'' magazine were all Columbia artists. (In the early 1960s Columbia jazz artist [[Thelonious Monk]] would be afforded the same honor.)

Columbia changed distributors in Australia and New Zealand in 1956, when the Australian Record Company picked up distribution of U.S. Columbia product to replace the [[Capitol Records]] product which ARC lost when EMI bought Capitol. As EMI owned the Columbia trademark at that time, the U.S. Columbia material was issued in Australia and New Zealand on the [[Coronet Records|CBS Coronet]] label.

In the same year, former Columbia A&R manager [[Goddard Lieberson]] was promoted to President of the entire CBS recording division, which included Columbia and Epic, and the company's various international divisions and licensees. Under his leadership the corporation's music division soon overtook [[RCA Victor]] as the top recording company in the world, with a roster of artists and a catalogue of popular, jazz, classical and stage and screen soundtrack titles. Lieberson, who had joined Columbia as an A&R manager in 1938, oversaw the release of many successful albums and singles, and championing prestige releases that sold relatively poorly, and even some titles that had limited appeal, such as complete editions of the works of [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Anton von Webern]]. One of his first major successes was the original Broadway cast album of ''[[My Fair Lady (Broadway cast recording)|My Fair Lady]]'', which sold over 5&nbsp;million copies worldwide in 1957, becoming the most successful LP ever released up to that time. Lieberson also convinced long-serving CBS President William S. Paley to become the sole backer of the original Broadway production, a $500,000 investment which subsequently earned the company some $32&nbsp;million in profits.{{sfnp|Dannen|1991|pp=60–61}}

In October 1958, Columbia, in time for the Christmas season, put out a series of "Greatest Hits" packages by such artists as Johnny Mathis, Doris Day, Guy Mitchell, Johnnie Ray, [[Jo Stafford]], Tony Bennett, Rosemary Clooney, Frankie Laine and [[the Four Lads]]; months later, it put out another Mathis compilation and that of [[Marty Robbins]]. Only Mathis' compilations charted, since there were only 25 positions on [[Billboard 200|''Billboard''{{'}}s album charts]] at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1200.html|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 8 (CL 1200 to CL 1299) 1958–1959 |website=Both Sides Now Publications |first1=Randy |last1=Watts |first2=Mike |last2=Callahan |first3=David |last3=Edwards |first4=Patrice |last4=Eyries |date=October 24, 2015 |access-date=July 2, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180819215009/http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1200.html |archive-date= Aug 19, 2018 }}</ref> However, the compilations were so successful that they led to Columbia doing such packages on a widespread basis, usually when an artist's career was in decline.

==== Stereo ====
Although Columbia began recording in stereo in 1956, stereo LPs did not begin to be manufactured until 1958. One of Columbia's first stereo releases was an abridged and re-structured performance of [[Handel]]'s ''[[Messiah (oratorio)|Messiah]]'' by the [[New York Philharmonic]] and the [[Westminster Choir]] conducted by [[Leonard Bernstein]] (recorded on December 31, 1956, on {{1/2}}-inch tape, using an Ampex 300-3 machine).<ref>This stereo LP Box Set (2 LPs) have released first as M2S-603 (MS 6038-9) in 1958.</ref> Bernstein combined the Nativity and Resurrection sections, and ended the performance with the death of Christ. As with RCA Victor, most of the early stereo recordings were of classical artists, including the New York Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by [[Bruno Walter]], [[Dimitri Mitropoulos]], and [[Leonard Bernstein]], and the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by [[Eugene Ormandy]], who also recorded an abridged ''Messiah'' for Columbia. Some sessions were made with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra, an ensemble drawn from leading New York musicians, which had first made recordings with Sir Thomas Beecham in 1949 in Columbia's New York City studios. [[George Szell]] and the [[Cleveland Orchestra]] recorded mostly for Epic. When Epic dropped classical music, the roster and catalogue was moved to [[Columbia Masterworks Records]].

Columbia released its first pop stereo albums in the summer of 1958. All of the first dozen or so were stereo versions of albums already available in mono. It was not until September 1958, that Columbia began simultaneous mono/stereo releases. Mono versions of otherwise stereo recordings were discontinued in 1968. To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the introduction of the LP, in 1958 Columbia initiated the "Adventures in Sound" series that showcased music from around the world.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Billboard|date=January 6, 1958|title=Columbia's 1958 Tee-Off Cues Big Product Campaign: Program Set to Tie in with LP Disk's 10th Anniversary Year|magazine=Billboard|page=15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Designed for Hi-Fi Living : The Vinyl LP in Midcentury America|last=Borgerson|first=Janet|publisher=MIT Press|others=Schroeder, Jonathan E., 1962|year=2017|isbn=9780262036238|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=283–297|oclc=958205262}}</ref>

As far as the catalog numbering system went, there was no correlation between mono and stereo versions for the first few years. Columbia started a new CS 8000 series for pop stereo releases, and figuring the stereo releases as some sort of specialty niche records, didn't bother to link the mono and stereo numbers for two years. Masterworks classical LPs had an MS 6000 series, while showtunes albums on Masterworks were OS 2000. Finally, in 1960, the pop stereo series jumped from 8300 to 8310 to match ''Lambert, Hendricks & Ross Sing Ellington'', the [[Lambert, Hendricks & Ross]] album issued as CL-1510. From that point, the stereo numbers on pop albums were exactly 6800 higher than the mono; stereo classical albums were the mono number plus 600; and showtunes releases were the mono number MINUS 3600. Only the last two digits in the respective catalog series' matched.

Pop stereo LPs got into the high 9000s by 1970, when CBS Records revamped and unified its catalog numbering system across all its labels. Masterworks classical albums were in the 7000s, while showtunes stayed in the low 2000s.

Columbia's engineering department developed a process for emulating stereo from a mono source. They called this process "Electronically Rechanneled for Stereo". In the June 16, 1962, issue of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine (page 5), Columbia announced it would issue "rechanneled" versions of greatest hits compilations that had been recorded in mono, including albums by Doris Day, Frankie Laine, Percy Faith, Mitch Miller, Marty Robbins, Dave Brubeck, Miles Davis, and Johnny Mathis.

=== The 1960s ===
==== Outing of "deep groove" ====
By the latter half of 1961, Columbia started using pressing plants with newer equipment. The "deep groove" pressings were made on older pressing machines, where the groove was an artifact of the metal stamper being affixed to a round center "block" to assure the resulting record would be centered. Newer machines used parts with a slightly different geometry, that only left a small "ledge" where the deep groove used to be. This changeover did not happen all at once, as different plants replaced machines at different times, leaving the possibility that both deep groove and ledge varieties could be original pressings. The changeover took place starting in late 1961.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1600.html |first1=Randy |last1=Watts |first2=Mike |last2=Callahan |first3=David |last3=Edwards |first4=Patrice |last4=Eyries |date=October 28, 2015 |title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 12 (CL 1600-1699/CS 8400–8499) 1961–1962 |website=Both Sides Now Publications |access-date=July 2, 2018 |archive-date=November 1, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171101005202/http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1600.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

==== CBS Records ====
[[File:CBSRecords.png|thumb|The CBS Records logo used outside of the United States]]
In 1961, CBS ended its arrangement with Philips Records and formed its own international organization, [[CBS Records International]], in 1962. This subsidiary label released Columbia recordings outside the US and Canada on the CBS label (until 1964 marketed by Philips in Britain).<ref name="Inc.1963">{{cite book |title=Billboard|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_eQsEAAAAMBAJ|access-date=July 21, 2013|date=March 16, 1963|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_eQsEAAAAMBAJ/page/n37 40]|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> The recordings could not be released under the Columbia Records name because EMI operated a separate record label by that name, [[Columbia Graphophone Company]], outside North America. This was the result of legal maneuvers which led to the creation of EMI in the early 1930s.

While this happened, starting in late 1961, both the mono and the stereo labels of domestic Columbia releases started carrying a small "CBS" at the top of the label. This was not something that changed at a certain date, but rather, pressing plants were told to use up the stock of old (pre-CBS) labels first, resulting in a mixture of labels for some given releases. Some are known with the CBS text on mono albums, and not on stereo of the same album, and vice versa; diggings brought up pressings with the CBS text on one side and not on the other. Many, but certainly not all, of the early numbers with the "ledge" variation (i.e., no deep groove), had the small "CBS".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1700.html |first1=Randy |last1=Watts |first2=Mike |last2=Callahan |first3=David |last3=Edwards |first4=Patrice |last4=Eyries |date=October 29, 2015 |title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 13 (CL 1700-1799/CS 8500–8598) 1961–1962 |website=Both Sides Now Publications |access-date=July 2, 2018 |archive-date=August 10, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810102321/http://www.bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1700.html |url-status=live }}</ref> This text would be used on the Columbia labels until June 1962.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1800.html |date=October 30, 2015 |first1=Randy |last1=Watts |first2=Mike |last2=Callahan |first3=David |last3=Edwards |first4=Patrice |last4=Eyries |title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 14 (CL 1800-1899/CS 8600–8699) 1960–1961 |website=Both Sides Now Publications |access-date=July 2, 2018 |archive-date=August 9, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180809011545/http://www.bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1800.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Columbia's Mexican unit, Discos Columbia, was renamed Discos CBS.<ref name="Inc.1963"/>

With the formation of CBS Records International, CBS started establishing its own distribution in the early 1960s, beginning in Australia. In 1960 CBS took over its distributor in Australia and New Zealand, the [[Australian Record Company]] (founded in 1936) including [[Coronet Records]], one of the leading Australian independent recording and distribution companies of the day. The CBS Coronet label was replaced by the CBS label with the 'walking eye' logo in 1963. ARC continued trading under that name until the late 1970s when it formally changed its business name to CBS Australia.

==== Mitch Miller on television ====
In 1961, Columbia's music repertoire was given an enormous boost when [[Mitch Miller]], its A&R manager and bandleader, became the host of the variety series ''[[Sing Along with Mitch]]'' on NBC.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128957153 |date=August 3, 2010 |title=Remembering Singing Along With Mitch Miller|work=Talk of the Nation |first1=Jim |last1=Bessman |first2=Tony |last2=Cox |first3=Mitch |last3=Miller |publisher=NPR |access-date=December 26, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171226130426/https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128957153|archive-date=December 26, 2017 }}</ref> The show was based on Miller's 'folksy' but appealing 'chorus' style performance of popular standards. During its four-season run, the series promoted Miller's "Singalong" albums, which sold over 20&nbsp;million units, and received a 34% audience share when it was cancelled in 1964.{{sfnp|Dannen|1991|p={{page needed|date=July 2022}}}}

==== Bob Dylan ====
In September 1961, CBS A&R manager [[John Hammond (producer)|John Hammond]] was producing the first Columbia album by folk singer [[Carolyn Hester]], who invited a friend to accompany her on one of the recording sessions. It was here that Hammond first met [[Bob Dylan]], whom he signed to the label, initially as a harmonica player.<ref name="bsn17">{{cite web|last1=Watts|first1=Randy|last2=Callahan|first2=Mike|last3=Edwards|first3=David|last4=Eyries|first4=Patrice|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 17 (CL 2100-2199/CS 8900–8999) 1963–1964|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia2100.html|date=November 2, 2015|website=Both Sides Now Publications|access-date=June 29, 2017|archive-date=November 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171101005227/http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia2100.html|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Bob Dylan (album)|Dylan's self-titled debut album]] was released in March 1962 and sold only moderately.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/20-things-you-might-not-know-about-bob-dylans-debut-album-764154|title=20 Things You Might Not Know About Bob Dylan's Debut Album – NME|date=March 19, 2013|work=NME|access-date=December 26, 2017}}</ref> Some executives in Columbia dubbed Dylan "Hammond's folly" and suggested that Dylan be dropped from the label.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/50-years-ago-today-bob-dylan-released-his-debut-album-20120319|title=50 Years Ago Today: Bob Dylan Released His Debut Album|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=December 26, 2017|archive-date=December 26, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226130324/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/50-years-ago-today-bob-dylan-released-his-debut-album-20120319|url-status=live}}</ref> But John Hammond and Johnny Cash defended Dylan, who over the next four years became one of Columbia's highest earning acts.

Over the course of the 1960s, Dylan achieved a prominent position in Columbia. His early folk songs were recorded by many acts and became hits for [[Peter, Paul & Mary]] and [[the Turtles]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/celebritynews/6201418/Peter-Paul-and-Mary-Top-songs-of-all-time.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220110/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/celebritynews/6201418/Peter-Paul-and-Mary-Top-songs-of-all-time.html |archive-date=January 10, 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=Peter, Paul and Mary: Top songs of all time|last=Willis|first=Amy|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=September 17, 2009|access-date=December 26, 2017}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Some of these cover versions became the foundation of the [[folk rock]] genre. The Byrds achieved their pop breakthrough with a version of Dylan's "[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]". In 1965, Dylan's controversial decision to [[Electric Dylan controversy|'go electric']] and work with rock musicians divided his audience but catapulted him to greater commercial success with his 1965 hit single "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]". Following his withdrawal from touring in 1966, Dylan recorded a large group of songs with his backing group [[the Band]] which reached other artists as 'demo recordings'. These resulted in hits by [[Manfred Mann]] ("[[Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)|The Mighty Quinn]]") and [[Julie Driscoll]] & [[Brian Auger and the Trinity]] ("[[This Wheel's On Fire]]"). Dylan's late 1960s albums ''[[John Wesley Harding]]'' and ''[[Nashville Skyline]]'' became cornerstone recordings of the emergent [[country rock]] genre and influenced the Byrds and [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]].

==== Rock and roll ====
When the [[British Invasion]] arrived in January 1964, Columbia had no rock musicians on its roster except for [[Dion DiMucci|Dion]], who was signed in 1963 as the label's first major rock star, and [[Paul Revere & the Raiders]] who were also signed in 1963. The label released a [[merseybeat]] album, ''The Exciting New Liverpool Sound'' (Columbia CL-2172, issued in mono only). [[Terry Melcher]], son of Doris Day, produced the hard driving "[[Don't Make My Baby Blue]]" for Frankie Laine, who had gone six years without a hit record. The song reached No. 51 on the pop chart and No. 17 on the easy listening chart.<ref name="bsn17"/>

Melcher and [[Bruce Johnston]] discovered and brought to Columbia [[the Rip Chords]], a vocal group consisting of Ernie Bringas and Phil Stewart, and turned it into a rock group through production techniques. The group had hits in "Here I Stand", a remake of the song by [[Wade Flemons]], and "[[Hey Little Cobra]]".<ref name="bsn17"/> Columbia saw the two recordings as a start to getting into rock and roll. Melcher and Johnston recorded several additional singles for Columbia in 1964 as "[[Bruce & Terry]]" and later as "The Rogues". Melcher produced early albums by [[the Byrds]] and Paul Revere & the Raiders for Columbia while Johnston produced [[the Beach Boys]] for [[Capitol Records]].

==== Ascension of Clive Davis ====
When Mitch Miller retired in 1965,<ref name="Inc.1965">{{cite book|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7iIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA3|access-date=July 21, 2013|date=December 11, 1965|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=3|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> Columbia was at a turning point. Miller's disdain for rock and roll and pop rock had dominated Columbia's A&R policy. Sales of Broadway soundtracks and Mitch Miller's singalong series were waning. Pretax earnings had flattened to about $5&nbsp;million annually.{{sfnp|Dannen|1991|p={{page needed|date=July 2022}}}} The label's only significant "pop" acts at the time were Bob Dylan, the Byrds, Paul Revere & the Raiders and [[Simon & Garfunkel]]. In its catalogue were other genres: classical, jazz and country, along with a select group of R&B artists, among them [[Aretha Franklin]].<ref name="bsn17" /> Most historians observed that Columbia had problems marketing Franklin as a major talent in the R&B genre, which led to her leaving the label for [[Atlantic Records]] in 1967.<ref>{{Gilliland|https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19834/m1|Show 52 – The Soul Reformation: Phase three, soul music at the summit.

In 1967, Brooklyn-born lawyer [[Clive Davis]] became president of Columbia. Following the appointment of Davis, the Columbia label became more of a rock music label, thanks mainly to Davis's fortuitous decision to attend the [[Monterey International Pop Festival]], where he spotted and signed several leading acts including [[Janis Joplin]]. Joplin led the way for several generations of female rock and rollers. However, Columbia/CBS still had a hand in traditional pop and jazz and one of its key acquisitions during this period was [[Barbra Streisand]]. She released her first solo album on Columbia in 1963 and remains with the label to this day. Additionally, the label kept Miles Davis on the roster, and his late 1960s recordings, ''[[In a Silent Way]]'' and ''[[Bitches Brew]]'', pioneered a [[Jazz fusion|fusion of jazz and rock music]].<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.allmusic.com/album/bitches-brew-r106167/review| title = Bitches Brew| author = Jurek, Thom| access-date = April 11, 2012| publisher = AllMusic| archive-date = January 5, 2012| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120105051040/http://www.allmusic.com/album/bitches-brew-r106167/review| url-status = live}}</ref>

A San Francisco group called [[Moby Grape]] had been gaining popularity on the West Coast, and were signed by Davis in 1967. As a way of introducing them to the world with a splash, they released [[Moby Grape (album)|their debut album]], along with five singles from the album, all on the same day, June 6, 1967, 23 years following [[D-Day]]. The album hit made No. 24 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], but the singles barely made a dent in the charts, the best performer being "Omaha", which lasted a mere three weeks on the Hot 100 reaching only No. 88. The other charter, "Hey Grandma", only reached the Bubbling Under chart and faded within a week. Also, there were some complaints about the obscene gesture made to the American flag on the front cover that had to be edited out on the second pressing, not to mention that the group started to decline in sales after that. The return on all the promotional budget for the singles realized nothing. Although the group made two more albums, this particular publicity stunt was never again attempted by Columbia or any other major label.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}

==== Simon & Garfunkel ====
After Dylan, Columbia's most commercially successful pop act of this period was Simon & Garfunkel. The duo scored a surprise No. 1 hit in 1965 after Columbia producer [[Tom Wilson (producer)|Tom Wilson]], inspired by the folk-rock experiments of Dylan, The Byrds, and others, added drums and bass to the duo's recording of "[[The Sound of Silence]]" without their knowledge or approval. Indeed, the duo had broken up some months earlier, discouraged by the poor sales of their debut LP, and [[Paul Simon]] had moved to the UK; he learned of his hit single through the music press. The song's dramatic success prompted Simon to return to the US; the duo reformed, and they soon became one of the flagship acts of the [[folk-rock]] boom of the mid-1960s. Their next album, ''[[Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme]]'', went to No. 4 on the ''Billboard'' album chart. The duo subsequently had a Top 20 single, "[[A Hazy Shade of Winter]]", but progress slowed during 1966–67 as Simon struggled with writer's block and the demands of constant touring. They shot back to the top in 1968 after Simon agreed to write songs for the [[Mike Nichols]] film ''[[The Graduate]]''. The resulting single, "[[Mrs. Robinson]]", became a smash hit. Both [[The Graduate (soundtrack)|''The Graduate'' soundtrack]] and Simon & Garfunkel's next studio album, ''[[Bookends (album)|Bookends]]'', were major hits on the album chart, with combined total sales in excess of five million copies. Simon and Garfunkel's fifth and final studio album, ''[[Bridge over Troubled Water]]'' (1970), reached number one in the US album charts in January 1970 and became one of the most successful albums of all time.<ref name="bridge">{{cite web|last1=Eder|first1=Bruce|title=Bridge Over Troubled Water|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/bridge-over-troubled-water-mw0000191730|website=AllMusic|access-date=April 11, 2012|archive-date=April 26, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210426023123/https://www.allmusic.com/album/bridge-over-troubled-water-mw0000191730|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Hoyt Axton and Tom Rush ====
Davis lured artists [[Hoyt Axton]] and [[Tom Rush]] to Columbia in 1969, and both were given what was known as "the pop treatment" by the label. Hoyt Axton had been a folk/blues singer-songwriter since the early 1960s, when he made several albums for [[Horizon Records|Horizon]], then [[Vee-Jay]]. By the time he joined Columbia, he had mixed successful pop songs like "[[Greenback Dollar]]", with hard rock songs for [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]], such as "[[The Pusher]]", which was used in the film ''[[Easy Rider]]'' in the same year. When he landed at Columbia, his album ''My Griffin Is Gone'' was described as "the poster child for 'overproduced,' full of all kinds of instruments and even strings".<ref name="bsn27">{{cite web|last1=Watts|first1=Randy|last2=Callahan|first2=Mike|last3=Edwards|first3=David|last4=Eyries|first4=Patrice|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 27 (K)CS 9900–9999 (1969–1970)|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia3100.html|date=November 10, 2015|website=Both Sides Now Publications|access-date=June 29, 2017|archive-date=April 26, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426172457/http://www.bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia3100.html|url-status=live}}</ref> After that album, Axton left and joined Capitol Records, where his next albums contained "[[Joy to the World (Three Dog Night song)|Joy to the World]]" and "[[Never Been to Spain]]", which became hits for [[Three Dog Night]] on [[Dunhill Records|Dunhill]]. Axton eventually became a country singer, and founded his own record label, Jeremiah.

Tom Rush had always been the "storyteller" or "balladeer" type of folk artist, before and after his stint with Columbia, to which Rush was lured from [[Elektra Records|Elektra]]. As with Axton, Rush was given "the treatment" on [[Tom Rush (1970 album)|his self-titled Columbia debut]]. The multitude of instruments added to his usual solo guitar were all done "tastefully", of course, but was not really on par with Rush's audience expectations. He commented to record label historian Mike Callahan: {{cquote|Well, when you're in the studio, they bring out all these "sweeteners" and things they have, and while you're there, you say, yeah, that sounds good. But then you get the album home and you almost can't hear yourself under all that.<ref name="bsn27" />}} Eventually, Rush returned to his usual sound (which he applied to his [[Wrong End of the Rainbow|next]] [[Merrimack County (album)|three]] [[Ladies Love Outlaws (Tom Rush album)|albums]] for Columbia) and has been playing to appreciative audiences ever since.

=== The 1970s ===
==== Catalog numbers ====
The Columbia album series began in 1951 with album GL-500 (CL-500) and reached an awkward milestone in 1970, when the stereo numbering sequence reached CS-9999, assigned to the [[Patti Page]] album ''Honey Come Back''. This presented a catalog numbering system challenge as Columbia had used a four-digit catalog number for 13 years, and CS-10000 seemed cumbersome. Columbia decided to start issuing albums at CS-1000 instead, preserving the four-digit catalog number. However, this resulted in the reuse of numbers previously used in 1957–58, although the prefix was now different. In July 1970, the cataloging department implemented a new system, combining all their labels into a unified catalog numbering system starting with 30000, with the prefix letter indicating the label: C for Columbia, E for [[Epic Records|Epic]], H for Harmony (budget reissue line), M for [[Columbia Masterworks]], S for movie soundtrack and original Broadway cast albums, Y for [[Odyssey Records|Columbia Odyssey]], and Z for every other label that CBS distributed (collectively referred to as CBS Associated). The prefix letter G was also used for two album sets—or the number of records in the set after the label letter, such as KC2.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.globaldogproductions.net/c/cbs-lps-us.html |title=CBS LPs – US unified numbering system |website=Global Dog Productions |access-date=July 2, 2018 |archive-date=December 3, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231203215759/https://www.globaldogproductions.net/c/cbs-lps-us.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The first CBS album released under the new system was [[The Elvin Bishop Group]]'s self-titled album on Fillmore Records, assigned with F 30001 (the earliest Fillmore albums had the 'F' prefix, rather than a 'Z'), while the first actual Columbia release under the system was [[Herschel Bernardi]]'s ''Show Stopper'', assigned with C 30004.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.globaldogproductions.net/c/cbs-us-30000-30499.html |title=LP Discography for CBS Records US combined numbering system 30000-30499 |website=Global Dog Productions |access-date=May 5, 2019 |archive-date=December 3, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231203215759/https://www.globaldogproductions.net/c/cbs-us-30000-30499.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The highest catalog number released in the old system was CS-1069, assigned to ''[[Sesame Street discography|The Sesame Street Book and Record]]''. Chronologically, Columbia issued at least one album in this series in August, but by that time, the CBS Consolidated 30000 series, which started issuing albums in July with the new label design, was well underway, having issued nearly 100 albums. The system was later expanded with even more prefix letters (including R and V for [[Portrait Records|Portrait]], A and W for Special Products, L for [[Sony Wonder]], S for [[Sony Classical]], N for [[Monument Records|Monument]], O for Chaos Recordings, and B for [[550 Music]]), which continued until 2005.

In September 1970, under the guidance of [[Clive Davis]], Columbia Records entered the West Coast rock market, opening a state-of-the art recording studio (which was located at 827 Folsom St. in San Francisco and later morphed into the [[Automatt]]) and establishing an A&R head and office in San Francisco at [[Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco|Fisherman's Wharf]], headed by [[George Daly (Music Industry)|George Daly]], a producer and artist for [[Monument Records]] (who inked a distribution deal with Columbia at the time) and a former bandmate of [[Nils Lofgren]] and [[Roy Buchanan]]. The recording studio operated under CBS until 1978.<ref>{{cite book |title=If These Halls Could Talk: A Historical Tour Through San Francisco Recording Studios |url=https://archive.org/details/ifthesehallscoul00heat |url-access=registration |last=Johnson |first=Heather |publisher=Thomson Course Technology |year=2006 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/ifthesehallscoul00heat/page/n104 90]–94 |isbn=1-59863-141-1}}</ref>

==== Quadraphonic Sound ====
During 1971 Columbia began producing records in four-channel [[quadraphonic sound]], using the "[[Stereo Quadraphonic|SQ Quadraphonic]]" [[Matrix decoder|matrix decoding]] system. These recordings were backward compatible on conventional two-channel stereo playback systems, but played four-channels of [[surround sound]] when heard with special amplifiers and additional speakers. Artists using this technology covered all genres, including classical music [[Leonard Bernstein]] and [[Pierre Boulez]], plus popular artists such as [[Electric Light Orchestra]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Ray Conniff]], [[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[Herbie Hancock]], and [[Blue Öyster Cult]]. RCA had already begun releasing quadraphonic recordings on [[8-track tape]] starting in 1970, and countered on LP record with the [[Quadradisc]] system. The RCA process required a special [[magnetic cartridge|phono cartridge]] for "discrete" four-channel playback unlike the Columbia "matrix" system. Although the Columbia process was simpler and quite effective, many consumers were confused by competing systems and sales of both were disappointing. Columbia released its last quadraphonic recordings in 1978. Starting in the 1990s multichannel surround sound music surged again with the popularity of [[home cinema]] systems. Many quadraphonic recordings were reissued in new surround sound formats such as [[Dolby Digital]], [[DTS (company)|DTS]], [[Super Audio CD]] and [[Blu-ray]], however, multichannel music still did not reach mass-market acceptance.

==== Yetnikoff becomes president ====
In 1975, Walter Yetnikoff was promoted to become President of Columbia Records, and his vacated position as President of CBS Records International was filled by Dick Asher. At this point, according to music historian Fredric Dannen, the shy and introverted Yetnikoff began to transform his personality, becoming (in Asher's words) "wild, menacing, crude, and above all, very loud". In Dannen's view, Yetnikoff was probably over-compensating for his naturally sensitive and generous personality, and that he had little hope of being recognised as a "record man" (someone with a musical ear and an intuitive understanding of current trends and artists' intentions) because he was tone-deaf, so he instead determined to become a "colourful character".{{sfnp|Dannen|1991|p=19}} Yetnikoff soon became notorious for his violent temper and regular tantrums: "He shattered glassware, spewed a mixture of Yiddish and barnyard epithets, and had people physically ejected from the CBS building."{{sfnp|Dannen|1991|p=21}}

In 1976, Columbia Records of Canada was renamed CBS Records Canada Ltd.<ref name=ce /> The Columbia label continued to be used by CBS Canada, but the CBS label was introduced for French-language recordings. On May 5, 1979, Columbia Masterworks began [[digital recording]] in a recording session of [[Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Petrouchka]]'' by the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]], conducted by [[Zubin Mehta]], in New York (using [[3M]]'s 32-channel multitrack digital recorder).

==== Dick Asher vs "The Network" ====
{{More citations needed section|date=June 2017}}
CBS Records had a popular roster of musicians. It distributed [[Philadelphia International Records]], [[Blue Sky Records]], the [[Isley Brothers]]' [[T-Neck Records]] and [[Monument Records]] (from 1971 to 1976). But the music industry was in financial decline. Total sales fell by 11%, the biggest drop since World War II. In 1979, CBS had a pre-tax income of $51&nbsp;million and sales of over $1&nbsp;billion. The label laid off hundreds of employees.

To deal with the crisis, CEO [[John Backe]] promoted [[Dick Asher]] from Vice President of Business Affairs to Deputy President. Charged with cutting costs and restoring profits, Asher was reportedly reluctant to take on the role. He was worried that Yetnikoff would resent his promotion. But Backe had confidence in Asher's experience. In 1972, Asher had turned the British division of CBS from loss to profit. Backe considered him to be honest and trustworthy, and he appealed to Asher's loyalty to the company. Employees at CBS thought Asher was a bore and an interloper. He cut back on expenses and on perks like limousines and restaurants. His relationship with Yetnikoff deteriorated.

Asher became increasingly concerned about the huge and rapidly growing cost of hiring independent agents, who were paid to promote new singles to radio station program directors. "Indies" had been used by record labels for many years to promote new releases, but as he methodically delved into CBS Records' expenses, Asher was dismayed to discover that hiring these independent promoters was now costing CBS alone as much as $10&nbsp;million per year. When Asher took over CBS UK division in 1972, a freelance promoter might only charge $100 per week, but by 1979 the top American independent promoters had organized themselves into a loose collective known as "The Network", and their fees were now running into the tens millions of dollars per year, Music historian [[Fredric Dannen]] estimates that by 1980 the major labels were paying anywhere from to $100,000 to $300,000 ''per song'' to the "Network" promoters, and that it was costing the industry as whole as much as $80&nbsp;million annually.

During this period, Columbia scored a Top 40 hit with the [[Pink Floyd]] single "[[Another Brick in the Wall]]", and its parent album ''[[The Wall]]'' would spend four months at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' LP chart in early 1980, but few in the industry knew that Dick Asher was in fact using the single as a covert experiment to test the extent of the pernicious influence of The Network – by ''not'' paying them to promote the new Pink Floyd single.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Sing a song of Spitzer |url=https://www.economist.com/business/2005/07/28/sing-a-song-of-spitzer |access-date=2025-04-16 |newspaper=The Economist |issn=0013-0613 |archive-date=July 25, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230725164647/https://www.economist.com/business/2005/07/28/sing-a-song-of-spitzer |url-status=live }}</ref> The results were immediate and troubling – not one of the major radio stations in Los Angeles would program the record, despite the fact that the group was in town, performing the first seven concerts on their elaborate [[The Wall Tour]] at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]] to rave reviews and sold-out crowds. Asher was already worried about the growing power of The Network, and the fact it operated entirely outside the control of the label, but he was profoundly dismayed to realize that "The Network" was in effect a huge [[extortion]] racket, and that the operation could well be linked to organized crime – a concern vehemently dismissed by Yetnikoff, who resolutely defended the "indies" and declared them to be "mensches". But Dick Asher now knew that The Network's real power lay in their ability to ''prevent'' records from being picked up by radio, and as an experienced media lawyer and a loyal CBS employee, he was also acutely aware that this could become a new [[payola]] scandal which had the potential to engulf the entire CBS corporation, and that the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) could even revoke CBS' all-important broadcast licenses if the corporation was found to be involved in any illegality.{{sfnp|Dannen|1991|pp=4–27}}

=== The 1980s and sale to Sony ===
The structure of US Columbia remained the same until 1980, when it spun off the classical/Broadway unit, Columbia Masterworks Records, into a separate imprint, CBS Masterworks Records.

In 1988, the CBS Records Group, including the Columbia Records unit, was acquired by [[Sony]], which re-christened the parent division [[Sony Music Entertainment]] in 1991. As Sony only had a temporary license on the CBS Records name, it then acquired the rights to the Columbia trademarks ([[Columbia Graphophone]]) outside the U.S., Canada, Spain (trademark owned by [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]]) and Japan (Nippon Columbia) from [[EMI]], a firm which generally had not used them since the early 1970s. The CBS Records label was officially renamed Columbia Records on January 1, 1991, worldwide except Spain (where Sony got the rights in 2004 by forming a joint venture with BMG<ref>[http://www.oepm.es/Localizador/LocNacExp] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040204010729/http://www.oepm.es/Localizador/LocNacExp|date=February 4, 2004}}</ref>) and Japan.<ref>{{cite news |agency=Reuters |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/16/business/cbs-records-changes-name.html |url-access=subscription |title=CBS Records Changes Name |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 16, 1990 |access-date=December 31, 2009 |archive-date=July 25, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180725033159/https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/16/business/cbs-records-changes-name.html |url-status=live }}</ref> CBS Masterworks Records was renamed [[Sony Classical Records]]. In December 2006, [[CBS Corporation]] revived the [[CBS Records (2006)|CBS Records]] name for a new minor label closely linked with its television properties (coincidentally, the new CBS Records is currently distributed by another Sony Music division, [[RED Distribution]]).

American [[talent manager]] Will Botwin was recruited in 1996 to serve as a Senior Vice President.

== Logos and branding ==
The acquisition of rights to the Columbia trademarks by EMI (including the "Magic Notes" logo) presented the company with a dilemma regarding which logo to use. For much of the 1990s, Columbia released its albums with the "walking eye" logo absent, just the "COLUMBIA" word mark in the [[Bodoni]] Classic Bold typeface.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://columbiarecords.com/  |title=Columbia Records Online – USA |date=February 8, 1999 |access-date=December 31, 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/19990208003842/http://columbiarecords.com/ |archive-date = February 8, 1999}}</ref>  Columbia experimented with bringing back the "Notes and Mic" logo but without the CBS mark on the microphone.

In January 2006, Sony BMG UK split operations into RCA Label Group, mainly dealing with pop and R&B, and Columbia Label Group, mainly dealing with rock, dance and alternative music. Domestic artists include [[Calvin Harris]], [[George Ezra]], [[Central Cee]] and [[Robbie Williams]]. Subsidiary labels include Ministry of Sound Records and Room Two Recordings.

In 1997, Columbia made an affiliation with the label [[Aware Records]] to distribute Aware's artists' music. In 2002, Columbia and Aware accepted the option to continue this relationship.

=== Columbia Nashville ===
In 2007, Columbia formed Columbia Nashville, which is part of [[Sony Music Nashville]]. This gave Columbia Nashville complete autonomy and managerial separation from Columbia in New York City. Columbia had given its [[country music]] department semi-autonomy for many years and through the 1950s, had a 20,000 series catalog for country music singles while the rest of Columbia's output of singles had a 30,000, then 40,000 series catalog number.

In 2009, Columbia Nashville became part of [[Sony Music Nashville]] under the [[Sony Group Corporation]] umbrella through [[Sony Music Group]].

===30th Street, New York===
{{main|CBS 30th Street Studio}}
In 1948, Columbia built additional new studios at 207 East 30th Street in Manhattan's Murray Hill district, naming them '''Studio C''' and '''Studio D'''. This complex, nicknamed "The Church" due to it having been built within an 1875 building that was originally constructed as a Christian church, was considered by some in the music industry to be the best-sounding room of its time, and many consider it to have been the greatest recording studio in history.<ref name="SIMONS"/><ref>Milner, Greg, ''Perfecting Sound Forever: The Story of recorded Music'', Granta Books, London, 2009 ({{ISBN|978-1-84708-140-7}}), p. 149</ref> CBS never took up the option to buy the building outright, giving up its lease and closing the studio in 1981. In spite of the building's inherent heritage status and its cultural significance, it was sold to developers in 1985, demolished, and replaced by a high-rise apartment complex.

===Columbia Square, Hollywood===
{{see also|CBS Columbia Square}}
In 1961, Columbia Records renovated and repurposed CBS Radio Studio A at the company's Columbia Square complex at 6121 Sunset Boulevard in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]], California. Columbia utilized the studio for recording and mastering services until its closure in 1972.

===Columbia Recording Studios, Chicago===
Columbia maintained one of its principal recording studios in Chicago (c.1939-c.1974). While under the ownership of CBS Inc., the label’s facilities were always housed alongside the network’s radio and television stations in Chicago (WBBM-AM/FM/TV). Before 1956, the studios operated out of the Wrigley Building; after that year, they moved to 630 North McClurg Court. The site was also commonly known as “CBS Studios, Chicago.”<ref>{{cite web | title=Columbia Recording Studios, Chicago Discography | website=[[Discogs]] | url=https://www.discogs.com/label/495099-Columbia-Recording-Studios-Chicago?srsltid=AfmBOopjc1CPZR12wyqLd3Dp6Ng8EzfJbnUaXTQI_HkAzCxsKRtMOvk- }}</ref>

===Columbia Studios, Nashville===

In 1962, Columbia Records purchased the [[Bradley Studios]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] (also known as the Quonset Hut), the first recording studio in what would become Nashville's [[Music Row]] district when first established by [[Harold Bradley (guitarist)|Harold]] and [[Owen Bradley]] in 1954. Renamed '''Columbia Studios''', the company replaced Bradley Studio A with a building containing a newer, larger studio A, mixing and mastering studios, and administrative offices. Columbia operated these studios from 1962 through 1982, when they were converted into office space.<ref name = "Skates">{{cite web|last=Skates|first=Sarah|title=Quonset Hut Hosts Reunion Celebration|url=http://www.musicrow.com/2011/06/quonset-hut-hosts-reunion-celebration/|publisher=Music Row|access-date=February 1, 2013|date=June 30, 2011|archive-date=September 4, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904232512/http://www.musicrow.com/2011/06/quonset-hut-hosts-reunion-celebration/|url-status=live}}</ref> Philanthropist Mike Curb bought the structure in 2006 and restored it; it is now a recording classroom for [[Belmont University]]'s Mike Curb College of Entertainment & Music Business.<ref name = "Skates"/>

Hollywood Records was formed in December 1989 by [[Michael Eisner]], then-CEO of [[The Walt Disney Company]], as a way of expanding the company's music operations by looking to develop and promote the careers of a wide variety of artists in various genres.<ref>{{cite news|title=Disney To Launch New Record Division|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1989-11-29-8903130790-story.html|access-date=July 17, 2014|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=November 29, 1989}}</ref> At the time, the company was limited to the release of soundtracks from [[Touchstone Pictures|Touchstone]], and [[Hollywood Pictures]] films.{{refn|group=N|[[Disney Music Group#Buena Vista Records|Buena Vista Records]] currently limited to the release of soundtracks from Touchstone, and Hollywood Pictures films.}} The first act to be signed to the label was [[The Party (band)|The Party]], after being formed from Mouseketeers on [[The Mickey Mouse Club]]. Lawyer Peter Paterno was the first president of the label, until his resignation in 1993 because of the division's lackluster sales. After failing to sign popular new artists such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[The Smashing Pumpkins]], [[Naughty by Nature]], [[Cypress Hill]] and [[Dr. Dre]], the label experienced its first major success in February 1990, when it acquired the North American distribution rights to [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s entire catalog for $10&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|title=Queen Signs With Disney, Raising Hope For Cd Releases|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1990-09-13-9003160958-story.html|access-date=July 17, 2014|work=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Los Angeles Daily News|date=September 13, 1990}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Wilker|first1=Deborah|title=Queen Must Decide On Replacing Freddie Mercury|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1992-05-07-9202100472-story.html|access-date=July 17, 2014|work=Sun-Sentinel|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=May 7, 1992}}</ref> The following year, the first Queen album under Hollywood, ''[[Innuendo (album)|Innuendo]]'', was released.

=== 1995–1998: Financial struggles and restructuring ===
Bob Pfeifer was named president of the label in March 1995 after a whole year without a president, but problems continued to the label and Pfeifer was fired in 1997, after the label revealed that he had lost over 150&nbsp;million dollars since 1990.<ref>{{cite news|title=Head of struggling Disney music unit quits: Walt Disney...|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1997-04-17-9704180160-story.html|access-date=July 17, 2014|work=Chicago Tribune|date=April 17, 1997}}</ref> In 1997, Disney acquired [[Mammoth Records]], in order to get an already-established record label that could succeed.

=== 1998–2012: Return to success ===
In 1998, Hollywood Records had its first major success in seven years with [[Fastball (band)|Fastball]]'s second album, ''[[All the Pain Money Can Buy]]'', whose accompanying hit single "[[The Way (Fastball song)|The Way]]" helped the label return to mainstream prominence. Five years later, [[Hilary Duff]]'s second studio album ''[[Metamorphosis (Hilary Duff album)|Metamorphosis]]'' was released and became a success to the label, selling over three million copies in the United States. The launch of Duff's career represented a new business model for the record, utilizing the synergies around the company, including important outlets like [[Disney Channel]], [[Radio Disney]], [[Freeform (TV channel)|ABC Family]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Duff's albums released under Hollywood proved to be equally successful including Duff's [[Hilary Duff (album)|self-titled third album]] and 2005's ''[[Most Wanted (Hilary Duff album)|Most Wanted]]''.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/08/arts/television/a-musical-for-tweens-captures-its-audience.html | newspaper=The New York Times | first=Ben | last=Sisario | title=A Musical For Tweens Captures Its Audience | date=February 8, 2006}}</ref> Duff's success led to Hollywood utilizing talent from Disney Channel (such as [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Demi Lovato]], [[Selena Gomez]], the [[Jonas Brothers]] and [[Bridgit Mendler]]) as artists into the mid-2010s, with several records that attained Platinum or Gold certifications. These artists' music careers proved the label to be successful. At the same time, the label continued to develop the careers of acts with a less mainstream profile such as [[Grace Potter & the Nocturnals]], [[Breaking Benjamin]] or [[Plain White T's]], but who had been successful in its own terms.

'''Hollywood BASIC''' [''[[sic]]''] was Hollywood's short-lived hip-hop subsidiary, run by Dave “Funken” Klein, which existed from 1990 to 1995.<ref>{{cite news|title=Disney's Rap Label Shows Conviction|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1991-03-28-9101280100-story.html|access-date=July 17, 2014|work=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Los Angeles Daily News|date=March 28, 1991}}</ref> It did not survive the distribution transition its parent made to [[PolyGram|PolyGram Records]], and all of its recordings were deleted, except for those by [[Organized Konfusion]], which were repressed under the new deal. It was the first label to record [[DJ Shadow]], releasing his "Lesson 4" (a reference to [[Double Dee and Steinski]]) as the B-side of a 1991 single by [[Lifers Group]], a hip hop group composed of prisoners at [[East Jersey State Prison]] in [[Rahway, New Jersey]]. It also released Shadow's Legitimate Mix on the B-side of a single by the group Zimbabwe Legit in 1992.<ref>[[Peter Shapiro (journalist)|Peter Shapiro]], ''Rough Guide to Hip-Hop'', 2nd ed. London: Rough Guides/Penguin Books, 2000 (p. 102).</ref> Arguably the most high-profile release was due to be ''BASIC Queen Bootlegs'', a 10-track collection of hip-hop remixes and reinterpretations of tracks by the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]] and featuring roster names plus guests such as [[Ice Cube]]. Although the ''BASIC Beats Sampler'' confirmed its release date for April 1992, the album was not commercially released, although it has since leaked online. Other notable releases came from [[Organized Konfusion]]; its challenging second album, ''[[Stress: The Extinction Agenda]]'' (1994), was widely acclaimed.<ref>Peter Shapiro, ''Rough Guide to Hip-Hop'', 2nd ed. London: Rough Guides/Penguin Books, 2000 (p. 291).</ref> The label was also home of [[Charizma]] and [[Peanut Butter Wolf]], although, following the shooting death of Charizma in 1993, the music the duo recorded for the label was not released. This would later inspire Peanut Butter Wolf to found [[Stones Throw Records]] in order to make this music available.<ref>Peter Shapiro, ''Rough Guide to Hip-Hop'', 2nd ed. London: Rough Guides/Penguin Books, 2000 (pp. 349–351).</ref> Acts on Hollywood BASIC's roster included Charizma and [[Peanut Butter Wolf]], Lifers' Group, [[Organized Konfusion]], [[Raw Fusion]], Hi-C, and Zimbabwe Legit.

{{Main|Hollywood Records discography}}
Upon its 1989 launch, Hollywood was distributed in the United States and Canada by [[Elektra Records]], at the time owned by Disney rival [[WarnerMedia|Time Warner]]. Distribution in North America switched to [[PolyGram]] (acquired by [[Universal Music Group]]) in 1995 (partnered with [[A&M Records|A&M]] in Canada until PolyGram's merger with the MCA family of labels in 1999). Today, Universal Music Group markets and distributes Hollywood Records catalog worldwide. Also, several Hollywood artists including [[Demi Lovato]], [[Bridgit Mendler]], [[Selena Gomez & the Scene]], [[Nick Jonas & the Administration]], [[Joe Jonas]], [[Miley Cyrus]], and the [[Jonas Brothers]] had signed to Universal Music UK's [[Fascination Records]].<ref>{{cite web|title=UNIVERSAL MUSIC, DISNEY MUSIC FORGE LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND: Forthcoming Releases Include Jonas Brothers and Hannah Montana|url=https://www.universalmusic.com/?NewsId=738|publisher=[[Universal Music Group]]|access-date=December 6, 2012}}</ref> There were reports in 2011 that Disney Music Group would start an independent US distribution arm for its label's releases, but this never enacted. Universal Music Group acquired most of [[EMI]] in 2013 but pledged not to renew its European license with Disney; both sides eventually changed their minds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1084095/universal-emi-merger-approved-by-canadian-regulators|title=Universal-EMI Merger Approved By Canadian Regulators|work=billboard.com|access-date=January 9, 2017}}</ref> In March 2013, Disney Music Group and Universal Music Group announced the expansion of their relationship with a new commercial and creative agreement that enabled Hollywood Records' artists to collaborate with the roster of producers and songwriters that are part of Universal Music.<ref>{{cite news|title=Universal Music Group (UMG) & Disney Music Group (DMG) Expand Agreement Globally|newspaper=PR Newswire|date=March 20, 2013}}</ref>
