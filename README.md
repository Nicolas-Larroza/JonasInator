# JonasInator
tiny wikipedia web crawler.

A small Python script that crawls Wikipedia articles using the official Wikipedia API, stores their content, and continues crawling linked articles to explore new topics.

# What i learned while working on this project:
- how to make requests with python using the requests library 
- how to work with wikipedia's api
- how to update a file while the program is running
- how to be a polite little bot (still working on that)

# What can be improved:
- remove duplicates from to_visit, or filter them from getting added
- handling edge cases
